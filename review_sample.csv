    First things first. My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile. 
------ 
 
I'm going to keep this ""review"" more of a opinion of Gintama's overall and then this season specific. 
 
Anyhow. What I have always loved regarding Gintama, is its content of everything. I love the comedy, its absurd, random, can be vile, dirty, sweet, anyhow, everything. Have laughed countless times in this franchise. Also the humor they have also is heavily reference based, a.k.a parodies of different anime, shows, manga, live stuff, real world, anime production and so on. Anyhow, comedy/parody side of this franchise i absolutely love. 
 
Now, 2nd side of this show is the serious dramas, epic battle shounens and so on.. There are arcs that are fully comedy, arcs that are fully serious and mixtures of both. Serious side is usually quite dramatic and managed to somewhat tear me up now and then. Whilst the action sequences are absolute bliss as well. They are just presented in a really cool manner. And extra points when sometime the add artistic element. 
 
Of course it has its slice-of-life side and pseudo-romance. Those are weaker side, but ain't the focus. But when sometimes those are the ""focus"", then they are done in enjoyable method. 
 
To sum up overall gintama's, I love the serious side and the silly side. 
 
Art and sound (voice acting/ost/op/ed) is something I loved in all gintamas across the board. They just click with me, bliss to look at, bliss to hear. Music (op/ed) specifically are hyped up and upbeat, which generally I don't like, but gintama is the exception where I love them. Art is cool, sometimes artistic, sometimes simple. It has a bit of everything that makes it enjoyable. And gore is absolutely satisfying as well. (well, the blood to be specific) 
 
Well, the serious side of stories in this anime are superb in my opinion. (or the overall idea of story that moves now and then). But wouldn't say comedic side of series story is any worse.  When at times comedy side has ""story"". It's usually quite enjoyable. 
 
Regarding characters I don't have much to say other than that variety, stereotypes of ""off-stereotypes"" is very large. As well characters with depth but as well with oddity is as well in great selection. Main team. Gintoki the lazy dirty slob with superb second side of seriousness and caring about friends/allies. Shinpachi the poor straight-man-act sidekick, who adds great value to the team. Kagura, the battle race girl that doesn't act like girl almost at all, or in another words a dirty slob girl in a sense. 
----------------- 
 
Now, to this season specific. 
 
I found it a bit disappointing. Mainly because usually in gintama we have overly serious arcs or fully comedic, whilst this one had a bit of mixture of both, which somewhat ruined the experience. Plus the artistic presentation felt this time around a bit lacking. Maybe because of another studio, who knows. But anyhow, it didn't feel as superb. Rather than gintama it felt as watching just another good battle shounen anime in modern day with simplified animation. 
 
I mean it definitely was not any bad, just didn't have the punch Gintama usually has. Might be because it was short series, maybe because it focused too much moving on with story. It'll be shame to see it finalized in this manner. 
 
Rest I pretty much loved as usual in Gintama franchise.

    Let me start off by saying that Made in Abyss is a series that deserves to be bestowed with the title of a Masterpiece of an anime series. This may sound like I'm placing the series on a pedestal, and you could say that personal bias has influenced by decision to rate MIA a full 10/10 for all the components, but please allow me to try my best to break down and pinpoint just exactly why it has earned such a place in my heart.  
 
Beginning with the first episode, which took me by serious surprise when I was left in absolute awe by the mystical vibes exuded by the astounding visuals and the beautiful soundtrack. MIA has one of the best first episodes I have ever seen thus far because unlike other shows where they bombard the audience with a complex plot in a desperate attempt to bait them into watching the rest of the show, MIA does that exact opposite. Instead, we tag along with our protagonist, Riko, and her adventures down into the abyss. Some things occur, and right off the bat, episode one was sufficient to leave me tense at the edge of my seat, yet the premise is simple and digestible enough for me to follow along. And at the end, we are treated with a stunning picturesque overview of the abyss, and that alone was enough to leave me desiring to be transported into their world and explore the abyss along with Riko. They had successfully pulled off their intended effect – to reproduce that sort of charm and mystery of the abyss, something that is so dangerous, slightly sinister, yet people, both the characters in MIA, along with the audience, are drawn to it.  
 
Moving on to the crux of MIA, the plot. The first few episodes mask the true sinister reality of the show and I was tricked into thinking this would be a cute adventure series with Riko and friends, but boy does that completely change in the next few episodes to come. Now don’t get me wrong, being ‘dark’ or ‘deep’ doesn’t necessarily equate to a good compelling story, as plenty of shows that seek to achieve such an effect often go beyond their capacity and all that remains is simply a cringefest of wasted potential. Yet, MIA absolutely nails in its execution. Even in earlier parts where there was a lighter more upbeat tone, the story never got stale and it was just downright entertaining to witness the happenings and adventures of Riko and those around her. And now that I think about it, it wasn’t really the plot itself that was unique or fantastic, rather, it's the perfect pacing and storytelling the series chose to adopt that really sold the show to me. I would go so far as to say that MIA is somewhat like a deconstruction of adventure genres and how behind the excitement and thrill of going on a journey of never return, lies the harsh brutal reality, something that even 12 years olds are not immune to, and are in fact more prone to its effects due to their fragility.  
 
I could not have asked for a better two main characters, Riko and Reg. One is an enthusiastic fearless adventurer and the other a shy yet fiercely protective friend. This iconic pair are extremely well written characters that spoke out to me on a profound level, weaving my emotional attachment towards them, and thus cue the tears and heartache when misfortune befell them. The complement and supplement each other in so many ways that it is just really darn endearing to see them interact. And due to spoiler reasons, I shall not delve deep into the third main character that only appears in the later episodes, but she, too, is absolutely precious and I honestly cherish the chemistry and relationships that they foster over the span of the series. Even side characters, including the most minor ones, and even ones that don’t even appear apart from through flashbacks and recollections, are memorable and they have that sense of quirkiness and originality that is in its own way a breath of fresh air after so many reused anime troupes that we have seen time and time again.  
 
Every single Friday for 13 weeks, this show was something that I really looked forward to. It was a spectacular journey and one that I am so happy I decided to start. It is absolutely magical and a feast for my eyes as with such a unique art style accompanied with the most detailed backgrounds. Every piece of music matched the scene so well and it was truly a beautiful symphony of sounds, visuals and storytelling. Thank you for reading my review of this Masterpiece and I hope that you will embark on the same journey as me and finish it with the same feelings as I did. :)

    Art 9/10: It is great, especially the actions during the critical moments in the game. However, it doesn't WOW me like the best in class. 
 
Sound 8/10: Very good voice acting, good sound effective during actions, good music that help bring out emotions and some of the op and ed songs are great. However, there is no sound track that are memorable. Can't give it a higher score. 
 
Character 8/10: There are many very different characters. Most of them are real and believable. However, most characters are stereotypes and there is not much development. 
 
Story 7/10: Overall this is a pretty straight forward plot with some twists. However, the pacing is a bit slow until the last 4-5 episodes.  
 
Enjoyment 8/10: Episode 23 and 24 are amazing 10/10. There are other moments that are great.  But outside of those, it was just good, 7/10. Overall 8. 
 
In my own rating system, a perfect show gets 9/10. If a show strikes me hard emotionally or teach me something that change my life, then it goes another +1. This is a 7/10 show in my mind. Good overall, I may rewatch some episodes but I won't go out of my way to do it.

    Story 
 
taking place 1 yr from where season 1 trailed off i really anticipated this series' return but was a bit disappointed by how everything seemed to restart just the way everything began with geass 1. the only difference is that the catching up isnt far off since lelouch already have that military might he didnt have when code geass began. aside from that, i was a bit disappointed with how geass 2 somewhat deviated itself from geass 1 in the sense that the focal issue of geass has been resolved within 2 episodes, leaving some other secrets about it uncovered making the series lose the &quot;essence&quot; of its title. 
 
if geass 2 was able to brag about something, it would be the world domination schema that would really perk up strategy gamers' interests. alliances and forged, countries are colored red or blue and the world was torn between factions. as a personal fan of strategy games, i considered this plot influence a plus. 
 
 in the end, code geass 2 reverted to being another gundam series that ends with one massive war and a use of nukes/superweapons and i think that in itself made geass 2 unimpressive. however, it's overall flow was realistic. technology was discovered to counter an opposing country's technology. the world competed with one another through technology and development and that is another great influence of watching geass in the long run. it makes people realize that this overpowered mech came into realization in order to counter this other mech. 
 
overall, geass have been bluntly a strategic action anime. it could've been better if they involved geass too and put it much in detail but hey. it happened, the season ended and everyone watched. 
 
Art 
 
the art is always good since it came from clamp but some angles would make me remember some SeeD characters such as kira and athrun. well it's all nice though but it's somewhat distracting since you're too much focused in the development of the story itself.  
 
the knightmares themselves were definitely stylish especially this time around. they featured much sleek and glossy coating that made me reminiscient of 00. there were also some knightmare designs that seemed to have been copied from Gundam 00 but i think that's plausible sincesunrise made both series. 
 
there were also some episodes released with poor quality but regardless, geass 2 was still fun to watch. 
 
Sound 
 
with nakagawa kotaro responsible for the bgm heard all throughout, there is no way geass wouldn't stand out. the opening songs by orange range and flow were good but the ending theme with ali project is/has that weird, uneasy impact on me. though i did like AP when they did the rozen maiden series, it somehow doesnt fit geass. i also didnt like how the final ep ended in an ali project end. it somehow doesnt feel enough closure like how they decided to end it on s1. that or maybe im requesting too much 
 
Character 
 
there were plenty of characters introduced this season as well as recurring ones. it seemed that every fanbase was influenced by geass such as lolicons, yaois, yuris, incest, and even some other unnamed weird bases. 
 
aside from fanservice issues, im glad to see that a lot of the cast of geass have matured. from the young boy that wanted to make a world for her sister now fights for the rest of the world. the knight that holds his principles have finally decided to throw them away. there were lots of changes, both big and small, yet contributed to the development of the story. there were characters to raged at, to laugh at, to cry at and every last one of them contributed in the enjoyment of geass 
 
Enjoyment 
 
aside from the return of overpowered mechas that does spinkicks and heeldrops, im amused the most on the display of wit and strategy that geass used all throughout. one thing that code geass dsitances itself from its gundam counterparts would be the sheer execution of strategy that does not rely heavily on a single unit's power. while lelouch continued to throw away lives, he made every sacrifice worth it. that virtue itself is something that would interest me in as how flawless strategies are executed and how and individual carries the burden of his choices.  
 
despite being given the power of geass, despite the actions taken and the decisions made, we also see the conflict of a young boy as he turned into a responsible man as he continued to carry the weight of his sins. as his influence grew and the hatred spread and how he finally resolved everything in one go. 
 
if there were some things that season 2 influenced me with, it must've been the weight of one's sacrifice and the growing up of one simple ideal into another. 
 
the boy who fought for his own happiness in R1 now fought for the happiness of the world in R2 and that in itself is a good way to close things regarding lelouch's personal issues. 
 
as ive said however, lelouch's issue is over in this series but the issue about CC and geass is not. if there would be an s3 it woudl definitely be a new story and a new cast 
 
Overall 
 
it was fun, it was depressing, it brought me to tears and rage and awe and dissatisfaction. even though the beginning was a bit good and the middle was totally off, the end topped it off but it still left most hanging. still, it never ceases to amaze me how much wisdom lelouch has. you can blame it to his experience in R1 and the things he experienced in R2 but still, the experiences he had cultivated him to make a &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; triumphant plan in the end and that totally impressed me with code geass. 
 
if this is the end of this series then i would surely miss the cast and crew of code geass.  
 
this is a job well done but i wished that they made something along the series to make it better.

    Kyoto Animations greatest strength is being able to create amazing characters, and then torturing with Supernatural happenings and in this case also; life itself. It's about friendship, growing up, love and loss.  
 
Everything about this anime is amazing, but if I have to say what is the best part about Clannad: After Story, It's it's characters. 
 
I think everyone would want a Tomoya as a husband, a Nagisa as a wife, an Akio as father-in-law, a Sanae as mother-in-law, Sunohara as your best friend, Mei as a little sister, Ushio as a daughter, Yoshino as a Colleague and in the end; even a Naoyuki as a father.  
 
Tomoya is a huge role model for me, how awful his life might get he still keeps going. He has shown me how huge of a wuss I am. He cries a lot in this anime and I dont think he is less manly for it(Since I cried with him).I really enjoy the types of leads that are sarcastic trolls and gentlemanlike at the same time(Like Yuuichi from Kanon), which can lead to very humorous but also very dramatic moments. 
 
Some people might think the ending makes no sense, and to those people i say(I can't stand them): Pay attention! 
The anime gives hints to what is going to happen, Think of what happens after Tomoya helps Fuko, Kotomi, Yukine and Naoyuki but also the whole ""girl in the illusionary world"" arc. 
In my opinion the ending beautifully ties everything together, with help of the amazing song: ""Chiisana Te No Hira"", which I still cannot listen without getting goosebumps. Which also gives a great ending to the story of the relationship between Tomoya and his dad Naoyuki. 
 
Clannad has changed my look on life for ever, And therefore I give it a 10/10, and have reserved the 10/10 slot on MAL for the series and only this series, because It's a different level of masterpiece. 
 
I highly reccomend you watch it

    When I first saw Code Geass I was like omgzxwtf it's mecha! Being a girl, I never did like mecha animes, but somehow decided to give it a try. And I'm glad that I did, because this anime is simply a masterpiece! 
 
Story: The story was well planned, however it got a little rushed as the series went along. Despite that, the overall story is simply astounding. It got me hooked from the first episode and I finshed both R1 and R2 in 3 days. The plot twists and cliffhangers in every episode will leave you wanting much more it's hard to stop watching :D 
 
Art: As expected from CLAMP, the character designs was magnificent. The background and the machines were all drawn in great detail and did not disappoint me.y 
 
Sound: Code Geass BGM was one of the best I've heard. The music really sets the mood, and you would still be listening to the music despite all the action going on! The voice actors were also well chosen. Jun's role as Lelouch was the best I've seen, though I never took much notice of him in Bleach (Yumichika). He really pulls off the different faces of Lelouch through voices alone! C.C.'s voice fits her perfectly too, giving off the mysterious feel. In all, great sound! 
 
Character: I like the way they portray the characters, showing that they do have weaknesses too, and not the IM INVINCIBLE YO mindless thinking. Enough to score for me. 
 
Enjoyment: I really enjoyed Code Geass as it was the first anime that could keep me hooked on it so long and made me think about the themes explored in the story. It really shook my opinion of what justice really is, etc.  
 
Overall: A greeeeeeeeat anime! The mechas are there to help the story proceed, the main theme in this anime is not just fighting, but also shows what goes on people's minds from both sides of the story. A really amazing psychological anime as well! I WILL MISS CODE GEASS D:

    As someone who loves Studio Ghibli and its movies, I expected to see something incredible and life-changing. However, this movie was kind of a disappointment as I found it hard to remain attentive or just care for the characters or the plot. 
 
Story: 6/10. 
I noticed that I am not really interested in adaptations of legends and myths despite my interest in them, as well as cultures of many different cultures, Japan being one of them. It kind of reminds me of Thumbelina (to an extent, although I am fully aware that the Japanese fairy tale is way older than its counterpart from the 19th century, please don't get me wrong). It's a story about a mysterious girl so beautiful that even princes were dying to ask for her hand in marriage. However, Kaguya's destiny has nothing to do with ordinary human life, even that of a noble. It's slow and overly complicated, which normally works in other Ghibli movies, but this time these unnecessary complications made this incredibly slow movie hard to watch. This movie is too long for such a short story. 
 
Art: 9/10. 
The art style of this movie reminds me of old Japanese engravings, I am sure this is the image the animators and artists were trying to create and they did a great job as it fits the atmosphere of the story perfectly, I have no complaints about it, so let's give this movie's art a 9 it deserves. 
 
Sound: 8/10. 
Shame on me, I forgot what the music in this anime was like so I had to look for it once again. And what can I say, Joe Hisaishi knows exactly what he's doing. Not his best work, but he is very talented and I give him credit for that, knowing what he is capable of. 
 
Character: 6/10. 
When you take an ancient simple tale to work with, characters may be rather simple sometimes. It's not a rule, but it is to be expected. They were okay, but, unfortunately, I found it very hard to genuinely care for any of them. However, showing no interest in any of the characters is even worse than disliking them, at least you do feel something when you dislike or even hate a character. They were fine, but that was it. 
 
Enjoyment: 6/10. 
I have to admit, I was bored. As much as I love and respect Ghibli and their attempt to turn this story into a decent movie, I failed to like it despite having such high hopes at the beginning, when I was just starting to watch it. 
 
Overall, I believe I should stick to other movies Ghibli has to offer as I enjoy them much more. Maybe this is not my kind of a movie, but this is the second Ghibli film (the first one being Tales from Earthsea, which is not that big of a surprise) I am not going to re-watch.

    Code Geass R2 is sitting pretty on myanimelist with a score of 9.00. The real question is, does it deserve this score? Sort of kinda maybe but not really. 
 
Story 7/10  
The first season had a great story which I really enjoyed, but Code Geass R2's story got so ridiculous at some points (such as that entire Sword of Akasha episode) that I couldn't help myself from laughing. They decided to throw in tons of random characters that are very very skilled at fighting among other things assuming that no one would question why the fuck they weren't helping Japan against the Black Knights in Season 1. They topped this clusterfuck of a story off with probably the greatest and most satisfying end to an anime in existence, so that's nice. 
 
Art 8/10  
Besides the triangle faces the art style is pretty basic and smooth 
 
Sound 9/10 
This show definitely has some good voice actors, that's including the dub Lelouch. His evil laugh gave me some serious chills. 
 
Enjoyment 9/10  
Here is where the clusterfuck of a story is redeemed, the enjoyment factor of this show is strictly a ""dumb fun"" type enjoyment, where as long as you turn your brain off completely, you should be fine. While ""dumb fun"" enjoyment isn't as fulfilling and memorable as the enjoyment you'll get from storytelling masterpieces like Madoka Magica and Death Note, it's still fun in the end. 
 
Overall 8/10 
 
I feel like they tried too hard to appeal to the masses after the success of season 1, but it's a good 25 episodes nonetheless, and the ending will always be one of my favorites.

    code geass is one of those series that everybody recomends and once you watch it you know why. 
 
Mechas, war, romance, comedy, rivality, unexpected twsits, explotions, mindgames and more mechas! what else do you want!!! xD it totally deserver its place as one of the best animes ever made. 
 
the only aspect i see as a flaw is the art with a 9/10 the people seem a little bit deformed or too skinny but once you get use to it is great! 
 
and it has by far the best story i have ever seen you just get hooked to it from the second episode and cant stop until finishing it. 
 
almost perfect serie, recomended to anyone who is a human beeing (nevermind, my dog liked it)

    Okay, so I was pleased to see that Clannad actually had a second ""season"" if you'll call it that. Seems like it is more of another series but with the same characters, rather than a continuation of the previous plot. So far, I was enjoying myself up until the story got to be a bit weird, which was around episode 14 or so. I mean that fact that Tomoya and Nagisa (main characters) are a couple that has been together for I'd say about 2 years and we still have yet to see them kiss, not to mention that fact that they get completely embarrassed about just holding hands?  
 
Soon after that, I think the writers of the series kind of wanted to see how far they could take things with the story. It gets very fast-paced, heavy, and somewhat depressing. Honestly I should've stopped watching after episode 14. It gets very sad and depressing after episode 15. But I applaude the writers for taking a chance like this. You don't see too many anime series end in the way that Clannad After Story did. Try it but be prepared for the unexpected (and Fuko (supporting character) doesn't make her ninja appearances)

    This story was… well confusing. The problem was that they had a ‘puppeteer’ who was changing people’s thoughts and memories in order to use it for his own purpose to hack into official’s heads. I won’t lie, I don’t normally understand all that political stuff. The fact that this was so heavy in that made it more of a chore to try and figure stuff out. If I missed something that someone said, to bad, I couldn’t really go back and check it out because I wouldn’t know where to find it again.  
 
When we get to the characters, the only ones we really get to understand slightly are Batou and Kusanagi. The others just seem like background characters compared to them. Even then, we don’t get much about the two although you can tell that Batou really cares greatly for Kusanagi. When we do get near the end, it does get into a rather interesting and deep. It really dives into physiological problems and aspects to life. It might of still been a rather confusing show but I did enjoy it. 
 
The art style starts out with a lot of CG stuff in the beginning of the show and then going deeper into the normal animation after. I have to say they really took me off guard when they showed the naked body of the major in CG while she was working. Of course then they had to have an opening that expanded on showing a women’s naked body being created through electronic means. There were little scenes where they would do a bit more of the CG and half of it is rather pretty. Some of the characters designs seem a bit off from how they looked in the anime that I had watched part of before, namely the major. Still, the camera angles and some of the ways they showed the world felt very classic to the anime style of the late 1990s.  
 
Some of the sounds are a bit off and the English voices sometimes don’t match lip movements but the voice actors really tried their best to make such a serious show work. You can tell just how they read their lines that they were trying really hard to keep it interesting but sadly, I keep feeling that they do a whole lot of talking and sometimes not all that much action or just a lot of shooting. When we do get action, its mostly slow movement, looped or over almost as fast as it starts. Now there are also some talks that feel more like a lecture about the problems with the cyber technology and a philosophy of having your own identity. These small parts were the only things that kept my attention as the others talks seemed a bit more complicated and I had no way of understanding the political problems.

    This anime (including season 1) is almost a perfect 10 but not quite there the art didn't really stand out at all but there wasn't anything bad. The charm of the series is the story it was full of sadness and heart break, but also some of the funniest moments in an anime i have ever watched. Without getting into too much detail this goes over the effects of season 1 (which you will need to watch to enjoy this anime) and the most amazing anime couple of all time. (although i did skip the episodes 4-8 because i heard they were boring af). The character, story, and enjoyment were far better than a number can describe, this anime left a lasting impact on me and my outlook on life. finally just like this review the ending was really damn confusing. I wish i could erase my memories just so i can go back and watch this anime for the first time again. PS I've been told rewatching it is a total mindfuck because you see everything that caused the ending unfold.

    To begin with Clannad is a very peculiar anime from the usual stuff i watch. The closest being Spice & Wolf as the two belong to the ‘slice of life’ genre. This is exactly what Clannad is as we follow the life of a High School Senior in Japan who just doesn’t know what he is doing with his life. On the most superficial level Clannad seems little more than a frilly series about finding love and all the stereotypes that are associated with that. To anyone who has watched the series though they will rapidly come to know that this is so far from the truth. What Clannad does so well is bring these characters, their lives, their struggles and their pains to life to the point where I felt like i was going through it with them. One by one we get a peak into the interworkings of peoples lives from the strange to the heartbreaking as everyone tries to be in it together. After all this and the typical High School anime setting the show takes a surprising turn with Clannad: After Story, which is very much dealing with what happens after ‘Happily Ever After’. This is where the struggle of finding yourself in the world and becoming one with society comes to the fore along with the struggle of holding on to what you love and the inevitable compromises that come with growing up. Clannad is a love story, and so is Clannad: After Story, but After Story is very much life as we all know it, with the good times, the bad times and everything that comes in between as we try to go through each and every day. This isn’t a show about heroes or leaders of men, but people. With Clannad i laughed, i teared up and outright sobbed with these characters to the point where i was screaming at my computer that ""It isn’t fair”. Then again life is rarely fair and makes those happy moments all the more precious. Clannad in so many ways just made me feel human like little else ever has. 10/10.

    Imagery is such a powerful component of world-building. It’s that one image, frame, or symbol that encapsulates a series so fully and leaves a lasting impression seared into memory. Here, it’s an abyss. And it’s such a perfect, haunting all-pervading imagery of a series that drags you deep into its pitch black vastness that invites mystery, intrigue, and, inevitably, questions. 
 
Welcome to the Abyss, a gigantic and seemingly endless yawning chasm whose origins and nature remain shrouded in darkness. 
 
The great city of Orth is built around a mysterious hole in the ground, one without a hobbit prancing about. It’s a much bigger hole than that, one that houses several mapped layers, all with unique micro-climates and ecosystems. Don’t hold your breath however. Much of the upper layers are bypassed in the haste to the deeper layers. Such a format is utilized to avoid stunting the pacing into a glacial crawl. Strangely enough, it’s that haste that actually causes the series to meander in the middle parts as a setting that offered so many possibilities ended up giving so little. 
 
The expectation set when one begins this story is that the focus lies in the abyss itself. The stated goal of the protagonist is to reach her mother at the bottom of the chasm. It is understood that the goal is immaterial. It is merely a catalyst for a journey… for THE journey. 
 
And yet this journey isn’t really about the abyss. That must be corrected before one enters with the wrong expectations. Made in Abyss is about the people exploring the abyss, not the abyss itself. I think that actually makes the title poetic. These people are “Made in Abyss”. This story is about how the Abyss shapes those who brave it. 
 
And that highlights its choice of protagonist: a wide eyed kid who’s just as enthralled by the wonders of her world as we should be, a kid filled with the sense of invulnerability and utter fearlessness that reeks of the sweet summer of youth.  
 
That enhances the kind of story this is more than it takes away. All too often we have protagonists who are jaded by the wonders their world has to offer. To see the brave new worlds through the lens of a kid experiencing them just as we are is a treat that should not be missed. 
 
And, more importantly, we start the journey tabula rasa. 
 
The anime did splendid job of circumventing the limitations it imposed on itself by the choice of protagonist. Riko, while chirpy and bright, simply cannot be expected to scale the chasm on her lonesome, or even with her little gaggle of friends. That’s where Reg comes in. Reg is a mysterious bio-mechanical relic of unknown origins saddled with his own limitations that both he and Riko must tango around. Yet even with Reg’s spectacular capabilities, one could still feel a sense of unease. A gut feeling says when push comes to shove, it’s not enough. 
 
Yet they persist. Along the way they are aided by the denizens and veterans of the pit: the jolly Hablog, the indomitable Ouzen, the troubled Nanachi, and the tragic Mitty as their lives are continually shaped by the calls of the great pit. 
 
Sadly however, much of the character progression is not felt. This is still a 14 episode series (that is, 12 normal episodes plus a one-hour special). But it doesn’t need such sweeping character arcs right now. This is the first of hopefully many adventures and it did enough on its own to establish the many characters with respect to the Abyss that captivated them. 
 
Much praise must also be lauded to the visuals, and especially the character designs. Such whimsical image serves to highlight the stark contrast with the brutal reality in a journey that strives to go deeper into the heart of the earth and innermost to the core of the yearnings that makes us human…  
 
 
…Into the abyss, with all of its attendant connotations.

    Made in Abyss. It was an anime at first glance seem like some typical adventure kids show. However, we are at the end of summer, and I am having a fucken boner. 
 
The anime was made by Ninema Citrus, which aired in summer 2017. By manga fans of the series, the adaptation was super hyped by the lot. However for us non manga viewers, it's a different story because of that chibi like art, which repels a bunch of viewers including me. I know a bunch of casuals who considered the anime trash because of it. But when I saw the anime being so high, I decided to watch it and let me just say, I saw why manga readers were hyped for this. It just did so many things right, hence delivering in every aspect to an extremely high standard.  
 
(Note: this was a repost of my first review, just tweaked.) 
 
Plot: 9/10 
The plot was done extremely well, I can't stress how much I loved it. 
 
The execution of the Abyss and it's mysteries were done excellently. I loved how we get just enough information to understand it, however doesn't give too much away. This allowed the Abyss to have possibly one of the best world buildings I saw in recent anime time, which must be credited. The story of Riko and the search for her mum was also executed well. I personally see this story as a way of revealing what the Abyss really is, and hence giving as a practical example of the dangers of it. The stories in between I found to be near perfect. They were engaging and at the same time, allowed the reader as mentioned to see the true dangers of the Abyss. Telling the story in the perspective of Riko was smart, as it allowed the reader to see how as an immature kid will she grow, which I'll get to how well this was done in the characters section. This story is quite complex, which is understandable since this is an anime for analysis. However it never felt too complex to the point of confusion, as the pacing was done exceptionally well. 
 
The pacing I found to be perfect. The slow beginning allows the reader when their minds are peaked with thoughts, to be given their first piece of information about the Abyss. After you are given your information, the anime immediately goes faster for you to experience these dangers, which in my books, is pure genius. However, I would had liked the beginning to be slightly shorter because it might had dragged on for far too long. 
 
I found the anime to stick to its genre. It was an adventure fantasy anime which was consistent throughout the anime. I found the main theme of the anime is being aware of what is real and what is words. The entire point of the anime is to mislead you to think something, however was really something else, which is a fairly great theme to explore. A sub theme is having friends which is a nice touch to this anime. 
 
Now the ending...ohhhh boy the ending was out of this world. It mixed the right amount of emotions to fully make the reader feel what the characters were feeling. It also built upon the characters that had yet to be built at that point of the anime. To add to the fuel of fire, the arc the series ended was what really made hardcore fans love this series, and I was no exception. I am sure this ending was a setup to get a second season of the anime. 
 
Overall, the plot was done to a brilliant standard. It had the right amount of execution of plot, pacing, exploration of themes and ending it in style to truly engage the audience into this anime. Despite things being off like the beginning, this anime certainly delivered in a plot aspect. 
 
Character: 9/10 
Characters were another very strong point of the series, and I'll explain why I believe this view. 
 
I found the characters to be very relatable. They all had reasonable motives into doing what they did in the series. Take this analogy, your friend is about to turn into Frankenstein or something through an experiment and you don't want them to suffer from this, so what would you do? Break them out, which did happen in some way in Made in Abyss, allowing these characters to be relatable. They were also realistic, especially Riko and Regu. The immaturity of Riko and Regular allows the readers to see them as themselves as a child, like I totally understand why she did what she did in the series, which is very good and should be appreciated.  
 
Development of characters was spot on. Riko definitely saw some development into a more mature character towards the end of the series, and certainly felt as though in the next arc, she won't commit the same mistakes she did in the first season. Her development was reasonably normal, as we can see how once she makes a mistake, it didn't happen again. Regu also developed as a person, gaining new skills as he journeyed with a Riko. Let me just say, these two as a partner has very good chemistry. They weren't the only characters fleshed out. Others such as Nanachi and Ozen also had their fair share of fleshing out. Without going into too much spoilers, I'll just say that Nanachi was what really made the series alive, which watching it will allow you to see why. 
 
Except the end, the antagonist wasn't really revealed, and I would had liked to see it more. The side characters were certainly an interesting bunch to me. They had the right amount of screen time to be seen, which made us not forget them for too long during their respective arcs. 
 
NanachiIsMyWaifuAndAllOfYouStayAwayFromHer-literally what it says 
 
Therefore, the character section of the anime is brilliant. The development and realism really sets the bar high for any other animes that can be closely compared to Made In Abyss, however I would had like to see the side characters just a little more than in the series. 
 
Animation: 10/10 
I actually found the animation to be the strongest point to the series for various reasons. 
 
To begin with, the designs of these characters were gorgeous, like holy sweet rabbit. The moment I saw some of these characters I immediately fell in love with them. I feel like the chibi designs were deliberate to truly show the immaturity of the main characters, and how they don't see the danger ahead of them. 
 
Animating the series was done well too. I did not see any sort of laziness and wasn't jarring to watch. The art style for this anime was very unique, like pretty much one of their kind, which is an art style I totally want to see again. 
 
The backgrounds were also out of this world. It gave an atmospheric view of the Abyss, and how there is something off with this world. I can't really complain too much about it. 
 
Overall, amazing designs. Animation, background and just the fact of the uniqueness of the anime truly allowed it to flourish in the animation department 
 
Sound: 9/10 
I found the song choices and voice actors to be chosen well, to the point where I had minimal complaints. 
 
The op is quite catchy, and gets you hyped up for the series.  The ending was also a nice close to the episode to me. Getting the voice actors to me was quite smart, as it further adds into the misleading nature of the anime. 
 
The voice actors played their part fairly well. No one really kept out of character, and they didn't sound too annoying at one point of the series 
 
Concluding this part, the sound was done well, however wasn't exactly an excelling point to the series. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
Every ep reinforces even further why this anime is brilliant. The anime manages to engage the reader through it's unpredictable nature, which by the anime goes on, the less predictable becomes. At one point my predictions were the complete opposite of what actually occurred, which was kinda sad in my part.  
 
Another strong factor which engages the reader is the characters, especially Ozen and Nanachi. These two characters are what really brought the series fully alive, and were very entertaining to watch for anyone.  
 
Nothing else much to say other then how incredibly engaging the anime was. 
 
Overall: 9.25/10 
Overall, this was definitely the dark horse and best anime of the season. People should never ever get misleaded by art, otherwise they'll miss gem animes like Made in Abyss. This anime offers so much to get the audience thinking, which they handled it perfectly by giving us the right amount of information to build on their fragile minds. The character development is near perfect, the music was good and the animation had very strong symbolism, it was just an anime full of mystery, engagement and sometimes even fun. I sure hope they will be a season 2 and will be equally as engaging as the first. 
 
I'd definitely recommend this masterpiece to any non casual viewers. Casuals will find this boring because of the lack of action scene and ""questionable"" art, but for non casuals, this is a very veteran anime you should get into. This is because of how you have to see between the lines to fully reveal the true nature of this anime, hence why I consider this to be for those who had a watched a handful of different genres of anime.

    This show has got to be one of the most well developed stories I've come upon. What I was most impressed by was the despite the complexity and genre of this story the writing kept it's integrity. Once you complete the show you realize that the writer knew what they were doing all along (which you would think is obvious but so many unfortunately do not do this) The characters and world building are fascinating and so much fun. The ideas of alchemy and biblical references and moral complications are utilized to a great affect. The dialogue is funny and natural, but the show can get really serious too. A good balance and well paced. (At times it can drag a little but it's rare) You even learn a lot watching it. The art style isn't my cup of tea but it's tight and the production was given money so there's never a lag of quality really. This is definitely a good, palatable classic. I'd especially recommend this if you're just getting into anime.

An anime brimmed with action and flashy fights, the word EPIC truly fits what One Punch Man is all about. 
 
There's not much development in the story, at least, it wasn't the main focus. It mostly focuses on this overpowered bald man who seeks the thrill and enjoyment of battles that he had lost due to his immense power. Not to say it's a bad thing, but it did leave me questioning 'Is there more to it?'. While the plot did progress halfway through, I think the idea of only revolving around battles diminishes the interesting aspects of the world of heroes, monsters and aliens. A lot of potential is out there and I believe that we'll get to see more of the other non-battle things. A stronger aspect that One Punch Man delivers is in the characters, especially the master-disciple relationship. Many of the other characters have their own cool power and personality so there's that boost of enjoyment. Seeing more of them is something I'll be looking for. 
 
So, what about the battles? I can definitely say that Madhouse has the skills to make the word epic pop out. No arguments could be made about how eye catching, fluid and powerful the animations were. It was outstanding. The lighting and shakes made the scenes intense with all the explosions and power produced by the characters. All the more so, the sound effects amplified this even further. For the voice acting and OSTs, it was kind of average with the exceptions of a couple soundtracks. They did capture the personality of the characters, especially the main character. 
 
One Punch Man begins as a story that fleshes out the world. We see all this powerful heroes and villains, but the story didn't really delve more into them except for the battles. I have hopes that their origins and goals will be introduced bit by bit in future seasons. In the meantime, this anime succeeds as being highly action-packed.

    One of the best anime I have watched. Characters are the FUNNIEST, yet powerful. I really feel bad for the villains :( There is no episode when someone is serious. 
 
The opening, oh my. It's very glorious, especially if you love rock/(sort of) heavy metal. These are the kinds of songs that you will love, even though you don't know the lyrics 
 
The story is just the best. THERE IS LITERALLY NO EPISODE WHERE IT'S SERIOUS. The shortness of the fighting scenes never get old. Yusuke Murata did a good job at making stories. 
 
So to conclude my review, i give one punch man an  ∞/10.

    DISCLAIMER: This is my first review written on this site, and I have been holding in this review for two months now, so bear with me on this. 
 
Ah, quite possibly the most successful anime of 2015, what can be said about it that already hasn't been? Like most shows that garner this level of hype, there are three distinct camps, two of which being the most prominent of them: those who praise the show as some messiah of anime, to an extent that sounds like their father had just come back from the dead or something, edgy hipsters that nitpick and bash the show just because it's popular, and the type that you find plenty of on MAL, but none in real life, the ones who say ""oh it's good, but not that good xd."" I happen to fall in the third, so here goes: 
 
SYNOPSIS 
 
- I will not address this too much, as everyone knows the concept: Bald guy seeks out opponents that he is truly matched by, because he beats them all in one punch, he gets his sidekick Genos, and a bunch of people come into play. I've had an interest in the series since it was shown in the 2015 anime lineup, given the premise and none other than Madhouse itself. I wish I had watched it weekly, rather than binging it after the show's popularity blew up. The idea, and genre labels itself should tell you how much you're going to like the show. It's no more than a parody of the shounen genre that shouldn't be taken so seriously, which is unfortunately buried in that sea of 10/10 ratings, and the #13 spot on MAL. Do not set your expectations of this show to be a masterpiece, or you will be massively disappointed. Set it as what you think the genre, and production credits entail. Half of the show relies on the joke itself, which is repetitive, and isn't one that most should be laughing at consistently.  
 
STORY 7/10 
 
- The story itself is quite simple, a proper introduction to our hero Saitama, and how he and Genos travel through short arcs with threats escalating in danger, and having more heroes, villains, and the ironic Hero Association slowly being unraveled over time. It's a formulaic cycle that relies on the distinctiveness of each arc's monsters/dilemmas, heroes, and set-pieces, which either hit or miss. There are genuinely funny moments, like the whole encounter with Sonic, some entertaining fights like the S-class heroes against the endlessly regenerating goons of Boros, but there are some failures like the moment where Mumen Rider is putting his life on the line against the Sea King in episode 8, only to have nearly immediate intervention from Saitama and Genos, as expected. I also feel like I was the only one disappointed by the fight with Boros. Yes, it was gloriously animated, had a well-placed use of the theme song, and the heralded ""OK"" face. It was memorable, but not for all the right reasons. The fact that he was letting himself get hit so much, wasn't to gauge his strength, but to prolong the fight. As Saitama did nothing but get back to Earth from the moon, Boros was saying ""oh, I should go all out,"" like what the hell? I know I will get shit for this, but I enjoyed the dream sequence battle from the first episode, and the sparring match with Genos and Saitama more, as they have more rewatchability, and are a little more clever than, ""let Saitama wait it out and make the guy give it all before the punch"" (the punch was amazing, I'll give it that.) The ending itself too just leaves itself on an unsatisfying note, and is in desperate need for a season two, but at least it sticks true to the manga events. Overall, the show does it's best to distract from the fact that you know Saitama will save the day, with some comedy, and glorious action scenes to do so. The short arcs are more about the journey than the destination, but sometimes the journey just simply doesn't work.  
 
CHARACTERS- 8/10 
 
- If all the Saitama profile pictures on the internet tell you one thing, it's that the show delivered on it's characters. This is the aspect that the show handles best in my opinion, as it expands onto stereotypes with clever placement, and outstanding character design which I will get to in a minute, but first, our caped baldy, the protagonist himself 
 
Saitama- Compared to the rest of the show, he is the most unique, and is one of the selling points of the show. The plain, sometimes emotionless hero, who only fights for fun. He works brilliantly, as a hilarious converse of the shounen protagonist, fighting for himself, not ""muh friendship,"" being overpowered instead of struggling for the sake of ""muh friendship,"" and just being quirky, but not a deconstruction. Rocking the Mr.Clean look, his yellow suit with the red gloves is as plain and distinctive as it gets. His expressionless face works, but sometimes it's not necessary. I'd honestly rather see the face on the cover of Road To Hero more often, that shit is badass, especially would work in the fight against Boros (sorry for slamming that fight, it's plain overrated.) His character doesn't develop, no one would expect that, but much of his memorability is owed to his sidekick, Genos 
 
Genos- The fangirl bait cyborg sidekick, the one robot who wants to know more about himself, and be as good as Saitama, by going under his wing. He himself isn't too interesting, but the chemistry he has with Saitama is executed quite well. Genos is the almost typical caricature of the striving anime guy with good looks, and this personality goes hand in hand with the carefree attitude of Saitama, the one he wants to learn from. The lack of romantic subplots leave a lot up to this duo's chemistry, and in that regard, the show gets it quite well. (100 push ups, 100 sit ups, 1 km run everyday!)  
 
The rest aren't exactly anything to write home about, the show focuses on them two, and the rest are relegated to side roles to propel specific episodes along. The thing is, they all embody some humorous spin on a well-known archetype, and what ONE does with these, makes for some really fun watching. Whether it be the endless wisdom of the Heihachi look-a-like, Bang, the endless justice pouring from the weak but courageous Mumen Rider, the characters will stick with you for how well defined they are. When you discuss the show with anyone, you will remember ""green haired brat,"" ""blue haired douche,"" ""gay prison dude,"" ""emo Sonic, with that inferiority complex tho."" In conclusion, the most well done part of the show, it doesn't need, but doesn't have any complexity warranting such a rating. 
 
ART 8/10 
 
- Look, it's Madhouse, it's quality. It's not their best, but it sure as hell works. It's not flawless, there are a few quips, like when Saitama fought that one monster underground in the white room, but overall, it shines when it needs to, such as the fight with Boros. Every character is well-done, in the style of the remastered art of the ongoing manga. 
 
SOUND 7/10 
- ONE PUUUNNNNCCCHHH!!!! *guitar riff kicks in* yea that's all there is to the soundtrack. Everything besides the opening is well-produced, and fits in, but nothing sticks after the two months since watching it. 
 
ENJOYMENT 9/10 
-It's not a perfect show, but it's a damn fun ride worth taking. I wasn't laughing as much as I thought I would, and I was sure let down by the hype, as anyone would be. It was still worthwhile and recommendable, and to  it's credit, it reinvigorated my love for anime.  
 
FINAL SCORE- 7.5/10, go watch that shit. Just see it for hype's sake, there's something good you'll take from it.

    There's almost a melancholic beauty to the way Clannad: After Story presents itself. It's very realistic, yet spiritual. 
It doesn't hold back on showing you the hardships of growing up, but there's almost a soothing quality to it. It's all got to do with the way they handle the atmosphere. The pacing is fantastic, which is amazing considering the story line spans the better part of seven years in twenty-two episodes. 
The series in general is a metaphor for growing up. In the first season the drama is often accompanied by humorously childish moments. It was a simpler and, for lack of a better word, happier time. In Clannad: After Story, the humorous moments mostly serve as means of nostalgia, for the characters to look back at the simpler days. But it's made very clear that those days are long gone. Nothing gold can stay, and it's time to look to the future. It's mature, it's realistic

    Holy fucking shit. Seriously, what the actual fuck. THIS is the ""masterpiece"" that I ""had"" to watch? I pushed myself through the boringness of the prequel in order to experience the supposedly ""amazing pleasure"" that is Clannad: After Story, and THIS is what I get? 
 
Look, I'll be fair. Clannad: After Story is not a bad anime. It's definitely better that its bad prequel. However, that's really not saying much, is it? While After Story manages to give us a more interesting story than its prequel, it falls victim to plenty of the same problems and adds some new ones as well. 
 
Story: After Story starts out exactly where the prequel left off: boring high school crap. After we have to sit through even more boring arbitrary sadness involving all the female characters that didn't get used up in the prequel, the anime finally graduates and enters the rest of the world. The story really picks up there, and we get to watch a few genuinely interesting episodes. Most of the cast is put on a bus so we can focus on the characters that actually matter without annoyances, and the events that unfold draw your attention. Unfortunately, there's a climax soon afterwards, and everything goes to shit again. The anime returns to shoving arbitrary sadness down our throats. I pushed myself through the boredom hoping for a satisfying conclusion, but I was disappointed, as the ending throws all logic and coherence in the trash can in order to force something impossible to happen. After the story ends there are two additional side-story episodes, which I didn't watch and therefore can't tell you about. I'm assuming they are bad.  
 
Art: After Story looks good, just like the prequel. The problem of female characters (or feminine boy characters) having way too large eyes remains, but other than that, no complains. The settings look good, the male characters look good, the animation is good. 
 
Sound: The voice acting is good just like that of the prequel, maybe a bit better. The music is basically the same, but it feels more intrusive this time. It's not bad on its own, but the way it is used can be really annoying at times. 
 
Characters: The main character is definitely more interesting than last time. It's also nice how most of the cast was written out of the biggest part of the show, since we got rid of subpar characters that way. But in general, there's not really anything else to praise here. It's not like most of the characters that remain are actually interesting. Not to mention that some of the new characters did not pull their weight, either. 
 
If you liked the first Clannad, watch this. You'll definitely like it. If you didn't like the first Clannad but are thinking of watching After Story because you've heard about how it's significantly better and a masterpiece and all those things, don't. It's just a waste of your time, unless you plan on using the knowledge to argue with Clannad fans.

    I just finished the OVA's, which quelled a small fear of mine about the ending 
 
Holy mother of god... I haven't cried over a piece of fiction in a very long time. Hell, the only thing I can remember that actually made me cry was the Gary Come Home thing from Spongebob, and that was when I was, what, 5 years old? Now, 12 years later, I am straight up sobbing over this show. I didn't think it could do it to me, but this show broke a streak of no tears over TV over a decade long. I've never laughed so much with tears in my eyes 
 
To be fair, when I originally started Clannad... I HATED it. I was only watching it because the guy who recommended it wouldn't let me drop it. So, I watched it... a couple of good episodes here and there but really nothing special. The end of the first season was alright but then episodes 5-9 of After Story were so bad I almost dropped it again. But I kept going, and I ended up binging episodes 10-19 in one afternoon, then the rest of it just now. 
 
This show really suffers from it's first episodes, completely unrelated and superficial nothingness. I'd say to skip them but the small amount of character development is worth it. I'm also not a huge fan of the art style, but you do get used to it and it actually kinda grew on me by the end. I'd been a fan of more realistic art styles like those used in Naruto or Beck (Clearly still anime but not over-done) but now I can say I've broadened my horizons.  
 
This show has the type of music that ends up sticking with you. The music you'll play in your head on a sad day that you won't be able to shake. Don't get me wrong, this show has RUINED MY ENTIRE LIFE... but in a good way. I love and hate this show. This show should be shown as torture for what it does to you emotionally. It is heart-crushing and soul lifting. It is just...amazing.

    ince there is no accurate description for this episode I'll explain it quickly here. It focuses on Nodame and Chiaki going to Vienna to visit the concert-mistress from Rising Star - Kiyora Miki- who is also getting ready for a competition in Paris. In the second half of the episode they are back in Paris and Mine [her BF from season 1] comes to see her perform without telling her. She performs and makes it to the final round -- I won't say what happens after that.  
 
But it's a really funny episode and it definitely adds to the story. I'd recommend watching it before starting the Fianle [season 3].

    Im normaly dont shead tears during any shows/movies, But Clannad After Story really knows how to build emotional develepment towards the chars. 
 
As most of the reviews say there was laughing, crying and unexpected plot twists. Im not normaly one to watch these life type animes... but Clannad has made me want to start watching them. 
 
I know this is proble the worst review around, because its the first one iv written. But this is the only anime that has effected me this much so i felt like i had to write a review. Its changed the way i think and im sure that will change the way i live. Truly a outstand peice of work

    When i tought u couldnt make clannad any better i was wrong the second season was Legendary for me.  
 
The romance got turned down but the drama got turned up by alot. This part of clannad focuses more on tomoya and his relationship to his little daughter ushio. So if ur looking for abit more drama then u will not be disapointed but if u want the same feeling as in the first season then perhaps you get alittle disapointed.

    This animé is beautiful, it's a work of magic. 
As I begun to watch this series I thought it was nothing special but oh, how wrong I was. It seemed like one of those high-school dramas. It was, but not in the way you would think. CLANNAD After Story is filled with both humor and despair, something that's hard to fuse in an animé. However, in CLANNAD they succeeded with a perfect contrast. It may seem boring from the start and maybe you'll think about it like a direct continuation of CLANNAD, but After Story is actually a lot different and it definitely has a deeper meaning.  
One tip, watch it.

    So this is gonna be a really short review because most people lose attention in under a minute. 
 
The first season of Clannad really disappointed me because it was slow and boring. I came into the second season really expecting to find the exact same thing. 
 
The first maybe 10 episodes or so are also like the first season. boring. However. after that is when things really start to get good. If you have dropped this series and only watched the first season, or the first 10 episodes of the second season, I would HIGHLY recommend you to continue watching this until the very end. 
 
-SPOILERS AHEAD- 
 
I cry when watching just about ANY anime but I cried about 5x as much during this anime. When Nagisa died I really did get depressed about the whole thing and wanted to drop it but I ended up watching the rest and really did enjoy it. When Ushio died on the other hand, I really didn't know what to think as I didn't think anything good was really gonna come of the rest of the series. I didn't understand what happened in episode 22 for a LONG time but I really did enjoy the fact that this series got to have a happy ending. To this day I'm not really sure if that ending was implemented to prevent thousands people from committing suicide, or if they really wanted a weird ending as that. Also, the hidden world stuff seemed very sketchy throughout the whole series.  
 
Overall, I give this anime a 9/10 because of the well-rounded characters and plot. I also very appreciated the happy ending because I was thinking of never watching anime ever again.

    “If you feel like crying you shouldn′t hold back your tears. 
You should let it all out while you still can.. because when you get bigger sometimes you can’t cry even if you have something to cry about.” 
 
Without drama, how will our lives be now? Will we be all happy-go-lucky and not think of disappointing things? Maybe; Well, I′m a sucker when it comes to Dramas. No, really. I hate it. It′s not that I hate Dramas, what I hate is me being a crybaby and a sucker when watching Drama-Romance Anime. Especially when there′s tragedy involved. OH HELL NO. I can′t stand it, it′s like I want to bawl my eyes out all day; But nevertheless, Dramas are one of the most popular genres, which, I like a lot, next to slapstick comedy, that is. Drama has it's own excellent attributes, and one of it is to make us shed manly tears. 
 
After Story made a huge impact on me, I was greatly dumbfounded by it's perfectness. It changed a lot of things for me; on how I view Drama-Romance anime, how a certain death can lead your life to going down. It′s hard to not shed a tear while After Story is playing right before your very eyes. 
 
Afterstory is all about, Love, Family, Grief, Happiness, Sorrow and Relationship. 
And how they prove that not all stories have a happy ending and that not everything are meant to happen the way they desire. All of this will be told by a certain person′s point of view, or how he views these “ends” and “endings” from his current standing and his current life. 
 
After Story is the continuation of the not-so-sad CLANNAD. We′re still in Tomoya′s perspective and point of view of the story, which is, perfect for viewing a certain person's life and beliefs. Although here in After Story, a lot of aspects and points from the prequel had changed. But that's what made the story and plot even more outstanding. 
 
The latter continues from where CLANNAD left off -- the path where Okazaki Tomoya is walking at -- Tomoya confessed and asked Nagisa out. Isn′t that a happy thing? Yes, it IS. After watching this scene, you′ll start to think that, things are going pretty well. And sure that it′ll have a happy ending; All of us want to have a happy ending in our lives, all of us want to experience love--to love someone and to be loved. Loving someone isn′t just a simple game that you play. You′ll experience lots of hardships, you′ll need to overcome obstacles if you want to be happy; And that′s what Nagisa and Tomoya were experiencing during the time that both of them fell in love with each other. 
 
Finally, after decades of waiting, ROMANCE barges in! I know we′ve all been waiting for this. And it really was worth the wait. After Story, being a Romance Anime isn′t all about love or full of 'cheesy' moments. Do not forget the Slice of Life here. The genres in After Story were distributed and divided really great. I like how when there′s romance, there′ll be an insert of drama or comedy from time to time. 
 
I really like how all the genres were mixed in After Story, but the genre who′s in majority is the DRAMA. After Story is an absolute tear-jerker; understanding the story from Tomoya′s perspective and point of view is one of the most saddest things to witness. 
 
The characters involved in the story had great roles which left a great memory and impact on me. I really like the mix of characters in the story: A Tsundere? I approve. A loli. A kuudere. A normal guy. A pervert. A dandere. They had great roles! All of them were part of Tomoya′s journey. 
 
I wouldn′t really call this as 'Enjoyment', rather, for me, this story isn′t enjoyable at all - in a comedic way. Albeit, After Story is much that of a super tear-jerker story. But we′ll use the term 'enjoyed' here on: I really enjoyed watching and witnessing the story of the people involved in After Story. All of the relationships were greatly pushed down to leave a mark. 
 
After Story had taught us lots of things: Having your own family is on of the best things in the world. It taught us that even the death of one person can break you down. It′s not all about SMILES and LAUGHS. From time to time, you need to let it all out. 
 
All I can is, people who were dearest to you that are now gone, must not let you down. You need to stand tall and be strong, no matter how much grief you′re feeling. Surely, it was a huge loss to you - but look on the bright side, there′s an 'alternate ending' waiting for you. 
 
Who knows. It might just be a nightmare and you′ll soon wake up from it. Think of all the good things. Don't think that nothing would change; every little thing and person in the world undergoes changes. And you′ll experience something far from what you expected. 
 
So just sit back and let the one-of-the-most-outstanding story take you away from your little world.

    If you watched the first Clannad and loved it, don't assume you'll love this one too. Clannad After Story is a completely different anime, while the first one is bound to appeal to audiences of all ages, this one is a lot more psychological and will not appeal to the same audience as its prequel. 
 
To put it simply, this is a tragic story and if you're not into that kind of thing I'd advice not watching this. 
 
It is by no means a bad anime though, I just feel like it is completely misleading, seeing as it is a sequel to a rather uplifting and jolly anime. I loved the first Clannad and I came to After Story expecting the same thing just with some final closure, instead I got something completely different.

    This is my first review so bear with me. 
 
I went into watching Clannad ~After Story~ right after having finished watching Clannad.  I was intrigued by how the story had flowed and by how brilliantly its creator had managed to capture the energy that comes with life in this series.  I was amazed even further as the story continued beyond your typical slice-of-life anime to show the lives of the characters as they continued along their chosen paths. 
 
Clannad ~After Story~ is more serious than Clannad was.  It does not, however, step right into a serious atmosphere, but instead flows the storyline naturally into the serious atmosphere as our own lives do.  It retains the happy moments that make you burst out laughing so hard you almost cry, but not at the cost of the story or the serious moments.  It continues to deliver on the atmospheres that the anime creates, no matter how sad, happy, or weird they may be. 
 
Unlike the typical slice-of-life anime, Clannad ~After Story~ dares to be different.  Instead of focusing a little on the pain that life brings and the joys that there are to replace them; it focuses on the reality of life as it is and the mindsets that are sometimes born from the joy or harshness of reality.  Despite doing so, it's not worth turning one's back on this anime simply because it focuses on reality as it is, instead of how we wish it to be.  That is not to say though that this anime focuses entirely on the negative.  Quite the contrary.  Instead, it gets you thinking on how we truly perceive the world around us.  If you are negative, then yes, you will see only the negative in this anime.  Positive, you'll see the joy that's hidden here. 
 
This anime is a must watch.  It has the rare ability to worm its way into the hearts of its viewers.  Deeper in fact if they've seen Clannad beforehand.  Equally, it dares to delve deeper than most anime wish to risk and does so in a way that does not leave the watcher hating the anime for it.  10/10.

    The continuation, with the part of the underworld. You immediately notice a change of style. If the first part (Hades Sanctuary) had dared, with some changes to the story and a bit of CG in the graphics, here we essentially stick to the manga faithfully, without even great animations. 
 
History manages to remain good, in the Underworld with Dante inspiration. The main problem is that that feeling of war is missing, the characters are scattered, and of serious battles, in true Saint Seiya style, there are very few.  
 
A fairly painful key is the characterization of the enemies. Except for Rhadamanthys, already presented in the previous part, most of the specters lack charisma, they save just a couple. 
 
Of course, there are some good parentheses (like that of Orpheus), some unexpected twists, some badass moments for a couple of characters, and an epic closure, but in general you feel that something is missing in this part.

    Also known as the Red Jacket Series, this second Lupin III TV anime appeared to combine elements of the manga with elements that were incorporated into the second half of the first series. Lupin's gang will steal from those who can take the loss and are either a criminal or some corrupt influential figure in society and will only resort to killing as a last resort or against criminals worst than they are. Fujiko making use of her body to get what she wants and Lupin's perversion are back, though these elements are somewhat toned down. Zenigata appeared to get the biggest shafting in this series as his character borders on incompetent and clueless in many episodes here, compared to when he was a more competent detective in other titles of the franchise who only fails to capture Lupin because of the thief being one step ahead of him when making an escape. 
 
Like the first series, many episodes in this second Lupin III series are non-linear and self-contained in their developments with each episode focused either on one of Lupin's heists, devoting focus to an element of one of his gang members/ Zenigata or dealing with a criminal threat within that episode. The writing in these episodes tend to vary ranging from subpar to very good as episodes that were grounded on a criminal element or Lupin's thievery were the highlight for me while any episode focused on some sci-fi or supernatural element got too out there for me with the show's comedy (most infamous case being an episode where Lupin and pals encounter a couple of giant ogres who make them into living shogi pieces). While the series is good at creating fresh episode plots to keep things from getting repetitive, the lack of any ongoing plot developments compared to modern incarnations of the Lupin III franchise may turn away some fans, especially with its lengthy 155 episode length. 
 
As to be expected of a series this old, the animation style is quite outdated with drab colors, simple details with scenery and character designs, and noticeable animation shortcuts and errors. However, a few later episodes directed by Hayao Miyazaki offer the anime's best visual presentation as their quality is more smoother with lining and there is noticeably more fluid animation compared to most other episodes within this series. Music had a mix of upbeat, energetic and tense tracks to compliment funny and serious moments within the show, including the signature Theme from Lupin III track used in two different versions for the anime's OP sequence. 
 
Overall, this second Lupin TV anime has the typical humor of the show that will make it a joy for fans of the classic anime character, though be warned the show's 150+ episode length and non-linearity may keep you from watching the series for its entire run.

    In Anime, there exists a few great works that structured the road and pioneered the way for those who came after them. Lupin the 3rd is one of those works. 
 
Starting the grandson of the first Lupin, Lupin the 3rd. Known all around the world for his thieving skills, charismatic personality, and monkey face. 
His gang of The marksman Gigen, the samurai Goemon, and the charming cat-thief Fujiko all link together for what to be a humorous set of adventures. 
The plot mostly consist of single-case episodes. Familiar faces pops-up every once a while, like Detective Zenigata, whose sole purpose in life is see Lupin behind bars. 
The series will take you into a world-tour journey as the great Lupin's adventures know no bounds! 
so you won't get bored of the same stages every episode. 
but you might get bored of its the simple nature, as the show itself is considered primitive, and you will find yourself laughing sometimes on things that were not made for that! (lazy drawings, goofy sounds) 
The staff behind the show like the animators and producers didn't really make a good impression, but you will love the classic voice actors who've done a great job with their characters. 
So basically, if you didn't like the characters, then you better off not wasting your time on 100+ eps anime with no serious plot. 
but if you do , then you will have your fare share of fun adventures and comical situations. 
I can finally describe this series as being very simple, yet very fun! 
The red-jacket Lupin is the best amongst the 3 Lupin TV series! and it made it possible for all the movies the came after it, much to the joy of the fans! 
 
This franchise has carved its mark on anime history, and it's on of those fine classics that any anime fan might want to check out

    Much like Part I of Lupin, Part II is Lupin and the gang stealing a variety of items from all over the world all while being chased by Inspector Zenigata.  
 
Compared to part I, this Lupin is more family fun oriented. Meaning, more comedy, less violence relating to murder, and more heists focused on ""operation-based"" stealing. The art and sound has significantly improved to the prequel, which has held up today. Our man Miyazaki played a role in a number of episodes relating to directing, art, and background art. 
 
Naturally being an episodic anime, some episodes are better than others. It isn't until episode 50 where two-part episodes come in, and the series gets a boost in entertainment. 
 
This is a good anime running 155 episodes to gradually watch over time. Nothing wrong, but I still prefer the more mature style that Part I had.

    After completing the first series which I enjoyed pretty much I immediately started watching this second one. And it really began good. Great episodes like their stay in Rio or the adventure with Nessie in Loch Ness, Scotland, are what I now simply call ""classic"".  
The problem with this series, though, is, that the episodes don't relate to each other. Ok, just watching one parter again and again can be fun, if you have to watch 155 episodes, though,  it can be really annyoing (I'm a Lupin fan ever since I watched some of the 90's films, so dropping was no option for me). This was also the reason I put this series on hold after about 40 episodes. 
 
Well, I continued watching it of course, moreover, I stumbled across  some nice to great episodes. One of them I'd like to highlight is Jigen's escape from Russia with a prima balerina. Amazing! 
However, after about 80 episodes the subtitles became horribly to read, why? Subtitles layed over other subtitles, really no fun. This continued until episode 130. 
 
As for the art and sound - don't expect anything too great. This anime aired from '77 to '80, besides, the music is mostly annyoing (especially the ""Super Hero"" song) 
 
In terms of characters...yaaay! Jigen Daisuke has become one of my most favourite ones while watching this series. Cool and calm, always ready to help Lupin, the womanizer out of his pinches. Lupin himself can be a pain in the ass, when he's trying to hit on women (and always fails xD). Goemon, who is cool, too and Fujiko complete the gang.  
Always persuing them is the (sometimes) lunatic Inspector Zenigata, a man who devoted his life apprehending Lupin bringing about more damage than he stops lol. 
 
All in all, if you watched the first series and you enjoyed it, this is a must watch, although there are so many horrible episodes. As a fan of the films I just had to watch this. And although I only give this a 6/10, I really don't feel as if I wasted my time watching it. The last episodes, by the way, where so good, that I'm looking forward to watching the third and last of the series.  
 
Thanks for reading x> !!!

    _House of Five Leaves_ leaves me nonplussed. Not really jidaigeki, not really revenge epic, not really drama, not really slice of life, not a particularly good depiction of Edo, I still never adjusted to the faces... (_House of Five Leaves_ would be more interesting if not for the faces alternately looking taken from _Kaiji_ or patterned after frogs. This is a problem for interpretation - I thought the female member was supposed to be deformed or ugly until the protagonist said she was beautiful!) I want to like it for being unusual, but I have to admit it gives me nothing to praise it for. It's just sort of flat - like Ishi or the protagonist.

    Story(8) - The story is set in a medieval traditional Japanese period of Edo where we follow a curious Samurai, the whole story merely tackles a character's past which is definitely unique.  
 
Art(7) - One can say the eyes and mouth were drawn weird, and it failed to give the required characters the ""look"" It has that style where it's very difficult to recognize characters unless you observe carefully.  
 
Sound(7) - Traditional Japanese melodies with flutes and such, it gave the subtle and the calm atmosphere. Also i love the way where the musician was able to manipulate the traditional music to suit particular moods such as ""humor"" and ""nostalgia"" The voicing was good, especially Yaichi's.  
 
Character(8) - The characters were interesting, especially the main protagonist and some members he associates, the situation where all the characters merge together is impressive. You can pry into different personalities and learn something.  
 
Enjoyment(7) - I enjoyed it in a calm fashion, everything is calm in that anime, there are no unnecessary fights, no commotions, it fairly gets to the point. There are some surprises here and there which captivates the audience. Humor-wise it's actually lacking, but there were some moments.   
 
Overall(7) - I wouldn't really recommend to anyone who needs a Samurai-like atmosphere as there is no excitement of combats, but it truly gives you a medieval atmosphere merged with elements of sadness,philosophy and calmness.

    A very unique art style to go along with its equally unique plot idea and story flow. In order to for one to happily watch his anime, you would need to be truly interested in character development. It follows a very bland main character into a world with the most unconventional people. It's historic setting (Edo Period) being very commonly used was not overly exciting to see again, but it was well done none the less. I found it enjoyable because of how each character had depth and  a back-story (even if not revealed totally or at first). The action part was low in quantity, but the surprise moments of violence were excellent and exciting enough for me to continue watching. = )

    I gave this series a 9 rather than a 10 purely because of the artwork and the music. The storytelling and characters were excellent in all respects and I was glued from start to finish (I watched the lot in a single day). However, whilst most of the artwork was excellent, the style of how the faces of some characters were drawn (particularly the females) - sharp pointed noses, large vacant eyes and gash-like lips, caused me to struggle to empathise with them. And the theme tunes were awful which is a shame as some of the music in the actual episodes was great. Thankfully, no annoying chibi characters, although the cat came close at times.

    Let me preface.  This is my favorite anime.  If you enjoyed Kaiba, Cowboy Bebop, or Usagi Drop, check this out. 
 
That said, I am a fan of character-driven stories and storytelling consisting of more show than tell.  Above all, Saraiya Goyou is in my book a masterpiece because of the adept, layered plot and well-paced story.  I must warn you, since I love this show so much, this review will be long and detailed.   
 
Starting with story (10/10), a social outcast, but skilled sworsdsman for hire, Akitsu,  
 is introduced.  Many anime titles (generic ones typically) would attempt to redeem the character, with the character we love proving him/her to the world.  This marks Saraiya Goyou as smart, breaking conventions. The story unravels the psyche of the main character and others over time.  As it is a Slice of Life, it also attempts to offer a glimpse of the real, sometimes harsh samurai world.  Yet it does so in a slow and relaxing manner, forcing you to feel sentimental, perhaps even pensive.  Story is a major asset of Saaiya Goyou, as every aspect of it (music, characters, art, etc.) are interwoven  through the world, without inconsistency.  World building is the strongest aspect of this series.  The tremendous depth of characters as we see their emotions painted across their faces, lets us dig deeper into a time, setting, and ultimately an individual.   
 
The art (10/10) of Saraiya Gayou is strong, if it does not rub you the wrong way.  Many would most likely be turned off if only fans of moe, shonen, etc.  This title is much more serious, therefore art follows suit.  The art is difficult for some people  because, although original, it is stylized.  Really, it fits well with all other aspects of the show, as it is both unconventional, and easily conveys expressions and gestures of characters, and helps establish the setting (a difficult feat for art to accomplish).  For example, the color palette is dreary, adding to the melancholic mood.  
 Animation is similar to what would be expected in a late 90's-mid 00's  anime, but everyone knows that is the best time for anime anyway.   
 
Admittedly, sound (10/10) is not something I spend much attention to, unless a score is otherworldly.  The score is similar to Mushishi's, quiet yet memorable, minimal and appropriate.  
 
The characters (10/10) are basically the plot, in that they are integral to the story; yes, all of them.  I will say that each character has their quirks and background.  We learn about them over time.  We depend upon information about the characters for the story to continue.  Since we spoke about plot no need to write further. 
 
Enjoyment (10/10).  Why 10/10?  It's my favorite anime of course.  Out of the anime I've watched there has been no other title, that offers as much of a complex or stylistic world.  It makes you happy you are smart, because Saraiya Goyou is extremely sophisticated.  Truly, this show treats us as if we were observers (flies on the wall), of an ethereally suspended place.  It unwraps to reveal a complex puzzle, candidly presented, with pieces faded and hinted scent of sweet, sickly passion.  Words like this better describe the show than using reasoning or logic.

    What an underrated and unpopular anime, which became one of my favorites out of the blue. I will get to the point immidiately. 
 
Story : 10 
Here is a story about a samurai with no self-confidence, who is gradually convinced to join a gang. There is barely any bloodshed, only the everyday lives of the members as they plan their new crimes. In terms of originallity, this anime is the top of the top of the samurai/historical genre. 
 
The purpose of this anime is not only to display the violence or the traditions of the time that it takes place. It is destined to recount the circumstances of each character and justify their way of life and their choices, which adds mystery and suspense to the story as well. 
 
Art : 10 
What can I say about it? I was completely taken by its landscapes, the details of nature-themed scenes as long as the town's buildings - I have never seen so detailed premises in an anime ever before. You may think that it doesn't make a difference, but it is really an eye-candy. 
 
Characters are designed in a very special and unconventional way, too. I found their eyes and hair very interesting, and as with the buildings, it was something I've never seen before. 
 
Sound : 8 
I really liked the themes played subtly throught the episodes. What I found rather odd and not fitting were the opening and ending themes. I think they tried to combine an old era theme with modern music (like Samurai Champloo), but didn't manage to make decent pieces. It was a pity, but didn't affect the overall enjoyment whatsoever. 
 
Character : 10 
The creator of the anime just nailed it. Absolutely likeable and utterly interesting characters. If I ever got into the thug life I would choose these homies. Really. 
 
The main character is a shy ronin, whose lack of self esteem is always mistaken for unreliability and troubles his career. He is struggling to find a master who will keep him as a bodyguard for more than a few days. But, as the story advances, you find out what a heart of pure gold he posesses. He's the kind of guy each of us would like to have as a best friend - you could always rely on him during harships or when you simply wanted someone who would listen to you and encourage you. A guy pretty naive that everyone would tease but love to have around. 
 
He eventually explores the personalities, motives and interesting backrounds of the rest of the gang members, as he is very curious of the people who is involved with and likes to consider them as family. Their characters are not black or white, they may be thieves but each of them could give you the most outstanding lessons about honesty anyone could ever give you. 
 
Enjoyment : 10 
Ι was fascinated. I watched each episode with irreducible interest. I recommend it to everyone.

    Perfect example of a hidden gem.  
 
Story 9/10: 
 
Story is perfectly enjoyable, kind of slice-of-lifey. The pacing is done just right. Other reviews mention this: this isn't heavy on action. Instead the feel is more of an slice-of-life adventure. Love it. 
 
Art 10/10: 
 
If your not used to seeing different styles of animation then it may be a little odd, but give it some time and you'll come to accept and hopefully enjoy it. Its *well executed, consistent, and fairly creative (the colors used are less so, but match well and I guess that's what matters more). Really enjoyed seeing a unique animation style that didn't feel ""experimental"" (not that there's anything wrong with that, but for some reasons they then can't seem to shy away from somewhat confusing mind games and narrative funkyness - this kinda show won't work with either). Love it. 
 
Sound 10/10: 
 
Never feels super high budget but always, always on point. You can tell from the very first episode that the sound was meticulous and designed very well. The music - and this I feel is a little rare even for shows that do sound well - is *very well hidden* but still carries a lot of tone/style/etc in every scene. I need to emphasize *very well hidden, its almost hard to notice - unless for some reason you wonder why you didn't notice the music and why the tone seems so flawless and flowing. Love it. 
 
Characters 9/10: 
 
Can't spoil much here. Not too many complaints - nice, realistic enough, unique, understandable characters. No wacky ideology, no weird meme beliefs, no dumb tropes, no not-so-dumb tropes, etc. Everyone just feels - *normal. And I think that's wonderful. Love it. 
 
Enjoyment 10/10: 
 
In case anybody reading this couldn't already tell, i Love it. 
 
Overall 10/10: 
 
Does a lot pretty dang well. Falls outside most of the other anime I've watched so far in feel and content, and even a lot of the manga. Its a little hard to believe its an anime but also has such a nostalgic ""anime"" feel. Feel like the 2000's - best period for these kinda shows idk why.

    Funny thing about coming across this anime, I originally thought it was named “House of Blue Leaves”, and I wonder after that, how in the hell did I get ‘five’ confused with ‘blue’? I guess I got “Kill Bill” on the mind when I thought of that title. Anyway, the anime is based on the Japanese manga of the same name by Natsume Ono and serialized in Shogaukan’s seinen magazine Ikki (from 2006-2010). The series is animated by Manglobe, the same company that brought you Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy and this is completely different from any samurai-based anime you seen before. 
  
 
The plot or storyline is focused on a samurai named Akitsu Masanosuke, a skilled and loyal swordsman who has no master under him and once again, he was been fired by his lords and start to look for bodyguard jobs and he find one working for a guy named Yaichi, the leader of the gang “Five Leaves”. As he is delve inside the world of the Five Leaves, the more he finds himself fascinated and involved with the people he associates himself with, especially some with many questionable past lives. 
  
 
You may wonder if there is going to be any action, thrills, or anything that expect from a samurai anime, well, you might want to keep on looking because it does not fulfill that need that you wanted. 
  
 
 
This is a samurai anime that is character and story driven and whiles the pace of the series does get numbingly slow in the beginning and it still gets that way towards the end and the amount of character development is adequate and well-needed but as for the story development, I never quite understand most of it halfway through the series’ runtime yet in some parts, I could make out some details of it. 
  
 
 
The atmosphere in the series including the main character design of Akitsu comes off as depressing and unenthusiastic, especially the latter. He really just looks like he doesn’t want to be here or just has the same emotionless, expression-less, Keanu Reeves look. However, he isn’t that bad of a character. I’m fine with him not being an all-mighty samurai. Not every character in every form of entertainment (especially Anime) needs to be this powerful character. All the other characters (especially Yaichi) are well-developed and practically carries the show. 
  
 
The animation done by Manglobe is non-traditional in character designs and backgrounds and while it looks fascinating to the eyes, it isn’t actually up to par and it can get very tiresome and I sort of gotten sick of that look during the 10th episode. The upbeat opening and ending songs really does contrast from the rest of the show’s bleak and bland tones. 
  
 
 
FINAL VERDICT: The show does manage to get story and character development spot-on, it is different than the other anime that is close to this but it is enjoyable to watch? Well, at a time, you can but it has an unbelievably slow pace that can turn off most viewers but a bad show this is not. An underwhelming show it is but would I suggest this? Uhhhhh………I don’t know. This is something you need to figure out for yourself but I can’t help you on this one.

    House of Five Leaves (Saraiya Goyou) is a subtle, samurai tale in Edo-Japan. If you are planning to watch this, do not expect fight scene after fight scene (hence subtle). The story is a blend of five characters lives into one storyline that explains how they all met, why they are friends, etc. The character development of this anime is very prominent and one of the best I've seen in a ""basic"" samurai anime. The animation art is different and that can be seen in the characters' faces; it is definitely unique. The show's soundtrack is a mix of present day and classic Japanese music, which I really enjoyed. Also, the sound affects were above average. 
 
I watched House of Five Leaves in one day and I couldn't stop until I was finished. AGAIN, do not watch this for action, since it is more of a(n) animation/story/character based show. 9/10, I really recommend this show, and since it's only twelve episodes it is very watchable.

    “My time with the five leaves was nourishment for the soul. “don’t care about the past, enjoy the present” The man in front of me is yaichi-dono, the one who taught me that” 
  
  
Althought Saraiya Goyou is set in the Edo period, it does not attempt to capture the ‘historical’ realism of the background premise. That much is obvious from its odd artwork and animation style. Neither does it aim at being an action samurai anime. Instead, it’s more of a character-centric seinen drama with a strong attention to detail on the characters, their motivations, expressions, actions etc.  Perhaps that is why it is considered ‘slow-moving’; the way the story moves with its characters (rather than the other way round) could put off those who don’t prefer character exposition heavy stories, or those who aren’t able to connect to the characters of the show. Characters are the key here. It’s not about the story, but the people who inhibit it. If you don’t feel involved with the characters, you’ll find the story slow and boring. 
  
The story is about a gang of kidnappers called “five leaves”, with which our main protagonist gets unintentionally involved. We see the story unfold mostly through the eyes of this new member. Masa is new to the Edo, and has desperately tried to cling on to his job as a bodyguard but he always ends up getting fired. On the outside, he looks like a samurai, but the problem is his timid personality; for some reason, Masa does not have enough self-confidence to even survive mildly aggressive social situations, and because of his docile nature has always ended up giving the wrong impression to his employers. It is this timid personality that has him involved with the five leaves, as its leader (yaichi) only needs a bodyguard for show to ensure minimum resistance.  
 
As the show progresses, Masa finds himself playing out a more important role in the gang.  The five leaves have some very interesting group of characters. The leader Yaichi is as cool as ice. Nothing seems to faze him and he always keeps a calm demeanor. But he has a mysterious past, and hardly anyone knows what his motives are. He isn’t doing the kidnappings for money, because he hardly spends the money on himself and seems to throw it around on people he knows. Masa finds this fact very interesting and most of the later half of the show follows him trying to understand Yaichi and his past. Then there’s the barkeeper, Ume, whose tavern is the most common meeting place for the gang and its members. Ume is a honest working man trying to support his daughter (Okinu) with clean earnings, but he has his own reason for being involved with the gang. Then, there’s Matsu, a former thief, and Otake, a local prostitute. All these people appear to be shallow at first, but they all have their own background stories and their own reasons for being involved with the gang, at the center of which is yaichi. 
  
In the beginning, it’s really hard to see what the story is about. You keep getting hit with flashbacks and subtle character expositions via dialogues and character interactions, and it could get a bit confusing. It was not before the fourth episode that I started piecing together the flashbacks and the present events. The show keeps giving you bits and pieces about the people and the gang, and you have to put up the pieces together to understand it. The show is often compared to Mushishi, and I suspect it’s because of this quality and the calm, unusually confident, pace of the anime. Just like an episode of mushishi, the show drops you in the middle of this situation and starts giving you clues, and in the end everything falls together. For that reason the show requires you to be attentive. If you’re an emphatic viewer who always looks for a deeper answer behind the things you see and hear, then this just might be the show for you. 
  
The background art for the anime -whether it be the trees, cherry blossom, the rain, a steaming tea-kettle, the bridge over a river, the houses, walls or the occasional countryside- is just stunning. The art is a bit simple, yet seems detailed; modern, yet fairly traditional. The color palette is deep and strong, and rather pleasing to the eyes. The character designs, however, may not be to everyone’s liking. With big round eyes, lean faces and slits for mouths, character art may turn off some people. Personally, I think the character designs are rather fitting; and if someone can stand those ridiculous moe characters, this should not be a problem. The art is quite detailed in some ways; you can see by looking into those eyes what kind of personality the character has, and all their body language and expressions deliver their emotions perfectly. 
  
The show also delivers well in the sound department. Background music goes well with the situation; some tunes are quite up-beat or buoyant, and some very subdued. The subtle pieces are rather beautiful, some hauntingly so, and all the tracks add a unique ambiance to every scene. The voice actors have done an excellent job, and the background sounds are quite decent. 
  
The calm pace and overall presentation of the show makes it quite relaxing. The show is perfect for someone who wants something soothing to unwind. Although I’d like to put a disclaimer here again, if you don’t like the art or the characters, then there’s good chance you’ll be bored to death instead. But the show is worth a shot just for its unique concept and its imaginative presentation.

    This anime receives far less attention than it deserves. If you've never heard of Saraiya Goyou, definitely take a moment to see if it's up your alley. 
 
The anime follows a strong, innocent, and timid samurai as he joins a enigmatic group in feudal Japan. The interactions between our uncertain protagonist and the group's charismatic leader resemble ""Of Mice and Men."" Overall, the story focuses on uncovering mystery, loss of innocence, and slow-paced atmosphere. 
 
One strength of the anime is that---while it has few action scenes---each of these scenes are crisp and impactful. Characters are nuanced and develop into more complicated individuals over the course of the show. Foreshadowing is well done. The show blends its slow-moving plot with a sense of increasing mystery. 
 
Perhaps one reason that this anime is not better known is the art style. The plot is slow moving, and it is sometimes unclear where the show is going. The anime does a better job of capturing its characters than telling a story. 
 
I would recommend this anime to viewers who enjoy slow-paced, introspective anime, or anime that are based on mystery and complex characters. This show is suitable for people in their 20's. 
 
If you are looking for more action, or want a positive, uplifting vibe, then I would look elsewhere.

    Set in the Edo period in Japan (from 1603 to 1868), this languid but engrossing anime focuses on a mysterious yakuza gang called the Five Leaves, whose members hang out in brothels and bars, drink lots of sake, and kidnap people for a living.  
 
Yaichi, its cool and seemingly careless leader, hires an extremely mild-mannered and hesitant wandering samurai (ronin), Masanoskue, to be his bodyguard. Masa spends the anime learning about each of the four members (a former geisa, a bar owner, a former robber, and of course the enigmatic leader, Yaichi), and searching his own moral principles to determine whether or not he wants to become the “fifth leaf” of their gang. 
 
The unusual art style is probably what makes this anime stand out most: the characters are all animated with very pointy noses and this horrible blankness in their eyes, as if to suggest a kind of existential emptiness, but it’s somewhat misleading, as most of the characters are quite emotional under their own particular moral structures. 
 
The slow pace was almost too much for me at first, but I’m glad I stuck it out because I really loved Yaichi with his pale, constantly half-lidded eyes and mysterious backstory, and he has great chemistry with everyone.

    I really, really love Lupin III. I'm definitely a biased reviewer, because Lupin is my favorite anime franchise out of everything I've seen, but I really can't express how much I adore it.  Red jacket can really be considered the essence of the Lupin franchise, and is often the one that people think of when anyone says Lupin. 
 
Story: 10 
Personally I'm a big fan of episodic type shows, and that's definitely what Lupin is.  The story isn't always captivating or original, because after 155 episodes it becomes impossible to not reuse the same gags, but I really enjoy it just because of the fun, casual writing and the characterization. 
 
Art: 10 
The art isn't exactly extraordinary, but it's an older anime- I love it because it lends to the feeling of the show and the franchise, and it really wouldn't be the same any other way. 
 
Sound: 10 
One of my FAVORITE parts about Lupin. The Lupin VA, especially in this series, do a fantastic job, and Yuji Ohno has been producing music for this franchise the entire time it's been airing- don't get me started on the music scores for the new Italian blue jacket series. It doesn't feel right without Ohno's gorgeous jazz composition, and they're the kind of OSTs I'd listen to in their own right, as music separate from the show. 
 
Characters: 10 
The piece de resistance of Lupin is definitely the characters. Because it's so episodic in nature, the characters are really what set the Lupin franchise apart. I can't say enough about how much I adore all the characters. They are very much stereotypes- a cocky ore-sama type thief, a Girl With Boobs, the best gunman and the best samurai, and a cop- but at the same time, they subvert their stereotypes in a way that makes them all the more engaging. Lupin treasures the loyalty of his friends more than anything, Fujiko has the brains and the brawn to seal the deal, Jigen is a secret romantic, Goemon's biggest weakness is women, and Zenigata loves Lupin to the point where he doesn't want him to die, despite and because of being his greatest rival. The uniqueness of each character in their own right is one of the biggest things that keeps me, personally, coming back. 
 
Enjoyment & Overall: 10 
I really, really love this series and this franchise. I'd say it's definitely a quality watch, and if you're interested in getting into Lupin but don't know where to start, either this or the 2015 blue jacket series (if you're hesitant about jumping straight in with pre-2000s anime) is a great place to jump off. Before you know it, you'll be like me, downloading every TV special and OST... ;)

    This is a classic that any anime fan should see. In my opinion, this is the jumping off point for Lupin. Watch this series fist! When I was first alerted to the Lupin franchise, it was through this series on Adult Swim's late LATE block. They seemed almost awkward about showing this, like, ""Here you go. It looks kind of funny, but it's hilarious. Could you maybe watch it? You know, if that's ok with you. I'll just leave it here where it won't bother you..."" 
 
A friend told me to watch it and I rolled my eyes.  I was iffy about it based on the strange animation style. And I wasn't too crazy that the show seemed to be just about a thief and an inept detective. But it's far from that.  
 
An inept detective? Well, I suppose that depends on the director or writer. In quite a bit of the first Lupin series Zenigata is a VERY good investigator who just happens to be dealing with someone who is even better. 
 
SOUND: This series also features some of the best voice acting in an English dub out there. While made in the 1970s-1980s, the references are heavily updated (at least, to when it was released in the early 00s) without seeming intrusive (with the exception of one episode that featured a ridiculous amount of celebrity name dropping). The VA cast is the same cast that went on to voice the video game. They also pronounce the names in the same fashion as the Japanese version and ALL the Lupin songs, which is great. Zenigata's voice is classic, although it borders on foolish instead of a serious detective. Lupin's is iconic, especially with that laugh. I don't know who voiced him better, his original Japanese VA or the English dub. Jigen's is great as well, although Goemon's is better (and less stilted) in later dubs. Fujiko gets the breathy voice that really suits her character and Michelle Ruff has been Fujiko's go to voice actress. 
 
ART: The animation for this series (the red jacket series) is all over the place. While the characters look the same for the most part, when Miyazaki takes over his episodes always have his distinctive look. Also, some episodes have blatant mistakes in animation or sloppy coloring. Others have some very detailed sequences. The style is, of course, skinny and definitely different from most anime you'll see. Monkey Punch had tried to make his style more Western. I'm not sure that comes across in the anime, but it's definitely unique.  While the art is out there, it fits with the manga. I think the style of this series was better than some of the later Lupin specials put out in that two-tone style from the 90s. It definitely takes some getting used to. 
 
CHARACTER: The issue with this dub vs sub is that some characters come across completely differently. Jigen, in particular, has much more of a sense of humor in the dub. The dub of this series is downright amazing, but we'll get to that later. The manga upon which this anime is based is non-canon, with the characters sometimes not seeming to know each other (or meeting each other for the first time in each chapter under different circumstances). The anime pays a bit of homage to that in terms of some of the cheap disguises, especially when Zenigata can't see through them even when, for instance, Lupin just throws on a fake mustache.  
 
STORY: The creators of the anime have a thing for religion and nazis. So many, many episodes have to do with one or the other. What I love about the Lupin series is that there's almost 200 episodes in the RDJ, plus other series and specials, and very rarely will them be too similar or unimaginative (despite the nazis). Almost every episode has a moment that makes me laugh out loud, and the crimes are usually very creative (even if they don't just bend physics, but destroy them).  
 
ENJOYMENT: I think Lupin is an anime staple. Watch it. Especially this series. In my opinion, this is the jumping off point for Lupin. Watch this series fist!

    I am surprised no one has written a review of this anime yet. Its kind of intimidating being the first one to write a review about a classic Anime like Lupin the third Part 2. 
 
Well lets get onto the review.The plot is about the adventures of famous thief lupin the third and his partners Jigen ( one of the best marksman in the world) Goemon (the samurai and thief that can even cut steel) And Fujiko ( a beautiful thief spy who often betrays Lupin and his partners) There is no real overall story just like Lupin Part 1 its basically episodic unless there is a two part special (which is rare but good). Its more light hearted than the first series and from what I heard also the manga. The first series was kind dark gritty and action packed, but Lupin the Third part two has more humor and a lot more operations based on stealing. It also has some serious moments that make the episodes good. 
 
The art is excellent for it time and I think it aged well. You can also tell that some of the newer anime might have gotten some of their inspiration from the character designs notably Lupin and Goemon. Also the background scenery from different places around the world look really good. 
 
Sound. The sound is amazing from the explosions to the car chases everything is done well. The best thing about the sound is the music they Got this Jazz thing going and it works really well for the series and they know how use the music and how to time it. The seiyuus are the best part of the anime, they don't miss a beat and really work well together and take their own character to a new level even some bad episodes are watchable cause of them. 
  
The Characters are best the thing about the series I believe. 
Lupin The Third- Greatest thief in the world, also really hard to kill and catch. only weakness though is women mainly Fujiko. 
Daisuke Jigen- The best marksmen of the group he is also pretty kool himself. He is also doesn't trust Fujiko. 
Goemon- The strongest swordsman in the world and he can cut anything even steel. he is very loyal and follows his own honor code. He also doesn't trust Fujiko. 
Fujiko- A sexy thief, spy and a traitor usually to Lupin. Always looking to get Lupins skills involved and then rip him off. She knows she can get away with it since Lupin is madly in love with her or just really attracted to her. 
Zenigata- the man that chases Lupin with limited success but never gives up. Always there to make it harder for Lupin and the Gang. 
The kool thing about the characters other than their skills and style is that they have a great bond and have each others backs (even fujiko sometimes) and they rather die than betray each other it really shows in certain episodes. 
 
I really enjoyed the series but i am not going to lie there are some episodes that flat out bored me but I think it might have to do with the person who directed those certain episodes. The humor is great but I do wish there was more blood and more episodes about people trying assassinate Lupin the Third or one of his Partners. Really enjoyable though if you looking for something to kickback and enjoy some laughs and clever heists and not think to much about. 
 
Overall i gave it a 9 I easily give high scores and I know that but I resisted giving this a 10 because some episodes were just not that good, but I still gave it a 9 because it is a classic and one of my favorites.

    I can't believe it's taken me so long to watch these. Straight off the bat, I'll say that the second episode is better than the first. The first episode, to me, was a sort of give-or-take situation as it didn't really mean anything for the characters or their progression.  
 
Before I get back to all that, I wanna also mention that the art is a step down from the usual series' art because these are OVAs. They aren't going to look as nice as the main series, so beware of that. Obviously, the music is always bomb, so that's a given.  
 
The second episode specifically was nice to watch because it did have some semblance of character development. Rather than a one-off, funny episode like the first episode was, this episode had a few sweet and contemplative moments that gave a little bit more insight into these characters and how they feel about each other.  
 
The first episode, like I said, wasn't much. The story wasn't really there for me, and it was just an episode meant for watching Yato screw around in Hiyori's body. Nothing special. 
 
These episodes were nice to watch to revisit the characters, but overall, the tone is much different than the main series'. Not getting those series moments with Yato that you'd normally get through the main series makes these OVA episodes lacking. But what can you really ask from an OVA, right? I've seen exactly one seriously good OVA, but otherwise, they're usually mediocre. I'm not gonna revisit these episodes in the future, but I don't regret watching them in the first place.

    Noragami. The anime full of repentance, emotion, sin, and forgiveness. Of course the OVA will be emotional as well... right? 
 
-Overall 
WRONG. It's hilarious. Absolutely hilarious. An OVA should remind the viewers of the original series. This OVA was definitely reminiscent of the comedy of Noragami, which arguably was one of the biggest parts of the show. So with a score of 7 in Story, 8 in Art, 7 in Sound, 8 in Character, and 9 in Enjoyment, I give the Noragami OVA a score of 8. It's very good, just like the show. 
 
-Story 
Yato possesses Hiyori's body now that she's in high school. (wait, she wasn't in high school during the main series?? wut... Japan, you've disappointed me.) Yato does all sorts of crazy things together with Kofuku (who's 3 kawaii 5 me). It's all fun and games until Tenjin shows up... 
 
-Art 
It's the same as the Noragami series. It's good, the character design shifts according to scene mood, which is great. Well, the Sakura trees also look really good. 
 
-Sound 
Same old good Noragami voices, soundtracks, and opening/ending. 
 
-Character 
Same enjoyable characters. I feel like Hiyori's cooler than she usually is. 
 
-Enjoyment 
That was one of the funniest things I've seen in my entire life. 11/10 would funny again. But actually 9.

    The Noragami OVA's or, in this case OAD's were pretty decent. You all know already OVA's are usually fillers and in Noragami's case that concept doesn't change. While they are fillers they're not bad though, they don't really have continuity with the story but there is enjoyment here.  
 
I personally really liked Noragami, and just the same I really liked these OVA's despite the fact that they aren't really story associated. Both episodes take place after the events of the anime i'm pretty sure, and that's actually cool considering OVA's usually happen sometime during the show in between episodes. While it isn't story heavy, the first episode does explore a bit more of the God's lore. The first episode mainly showcases Yato's antics and it's pretty entertaining to see with some appearances from the anime's side characters which is nice to see. The episode wasn't anything special at all, but it entertaining and a fun watch nonetheless. The second episode was better, showing alot of chemistry and interplay between the other God's. While it didn't have action, i really enjoyed seeing the Gods all come together and interact with eachother. The characters are fleshed out a bit more and like I said it's nice to see them all hang out with eachother. There is a bit of a plot twist that makes things a bit more interesting but again it's nothing spectacular. It was funny to see things so light hearted and then take a crazy turn towards the end. The Gods all had funny moments and i'd say that and their interplay together entertained me the most. The animation and sound goes without saying, they are fantastic just as they are in the show. 
 
Overall i enjoyed them, they're nothing that great but I did like them and I don't feel I wasted my time at all. If you liked the show i'd give this a watch. It's full of lighthearted funny moments and further develops the characters of the show. 
 
If you agreed with my review give it a thumbs up (:

    This was a little different from what I was expecting after watching the Noragami TV series.   
 
Exactly the same characters show up, but the tone of this story was entirely of the character driven comedy that punctuates the TV series instead of the ""serious"" tone of the battles and phantom/god issues tackled there. 
 
But the story feels like fluffy filler instead of something that was written to push the plot forward.  It does not introduce a new sub plot in the background for a at-this-point-theoretical season 2.  Nor does it address any of the hinted future subplots that were introduced in the last episode of season 1. 
 
This OAV, or OAD as they call it, actually gives me hope for the series:  The writer(s) are willing to go outside of the standard battle manga formula that dominated much of the series.

    Wow, way to shit on a series. The OVA that should not have been. 
 
The first episode just fucks up the series royally and after having watched the series it is hard to see that as canon. 
 
The second episode is a bit better but in the end still feels off-canon and weird. Also, it includes spoilers since it skips quite a few volumes. 
 
If you like Noragami, do yourself a favour and don't watch this till you've watched everything else. 
 
Since this review was supposedly still not long enough, I'll have to write some more. 
I really don't understand for who the second episode of the OVA was meant for since it was in the middle of some situation which the viewer who came straight from the series wouldn't know.

    First of all, do not attempt to watch this directly after or before the first season (Noragami), you MUST only watch these two episodes after seeing all first 6 episodes from the second season (Noragami Aragato), or else, major spoilers are going wrap. Make sure you watch the second episode of the OVA first, then the first. I know that's an odd order, but trust me, that's the right order to follow. 
 
- Story (7.5/10): 
Pretty decent side stories for fun, no particular big plot surprise or anything aside from containing spoilers of the first 6 episodes of Noragami Aragato. 
The first OVA resolves around Yato taking over Hyori's body while he goes into a carefree spree around her school doing all sort of stuff in her name, with the rest of the folks trying to stop him. 
The second OVA contains some major spoilers, but let's say the crew in its entirety goes on in a picnic, and have some actual fun until Yato pulls off a surprising highly-wished-for stunt. 
 
- Art (8.0/10): 
The same slick and smooth art style and animation from the first season, really, nothing too spectacular and beyond decent I'd say. 
 
- Sound (8.0/10): 
I'm more happy to hear the first season's opening and ending theme songs, these OVA focused on a more comedic light hearted stuff, so there was no inclusion of the fantastic dark soundtrack, but the comedy makes up for that. 
 
- Character (8.5/10): 
I love the cast of these OVA, all lovable characters. and Hyori isn't as annoying as people see here so often. Everybody was easy going and invested in the comedy, good days to remember. 
 
- Enjoyment (9.0/10): 
Ahh, the time went by like a fly, and that only happens when you're having fun. I really liked these side stories and hopefully, I get to see more of these soon because nothing can make up for the sad fact of you ending a spectacular show like this than having to see some extras. 
 
- Overall (8.2/10): 
I could actually highly recommend watching these, not like most OVAs who provide dead content, these ones had a lot to offer, and I'm specifically talking about a certain moment on the second OVA, god bless.

    Noragami, as I really liked the anime series, I really couldn't wait to see how the story continued, so I read the manga. Then I discovered there was an OVA. I didn't expect much, as most OVAs are kind of like a filler episode, without much of a story. 
 
This OVA was absolutely great! One of the best OVAs really, and that must be because the OVA follows the continuation of the manga. The story itself isn't much, I think it was kind of like a small filler arc in the manga. Yet it's really enjoyable, it's funny to see how Yato possesses Hiyori, and to see how he enjoys the ordinary high school life of a human, as a God ofcourse. Given Yato's funny and outgoing personality you wont be disappointed by the humour of the OVA.  
The sounds and art is the same as with the series, same amazing opening, and very good animation.  
There isn't much to tell about the OVA, since it's just one episode yet, but if you liked Noragami you'll like this extra episode for sure, for if you can't wait for a second season, like me.  
 
There will be 2 OVAs of Noragami, yet there has only been released one. The second OVA will also follow the story of the manga, so I can't wait. 
 
In short, it's just really a refreshing, good episode, with the humour it should have. If you like Noragami, it's a given you'll like the OVA as well.

    So, first of all let me say one thing: If you have not yet read the manga, watching the second OVA is not recommendable as it takes place immediately after the next big arc in the manga. It thus contains major spoilers for this arc. 
Additionally you won't be able to understand the deep meaning behind these scenes under the cherry tree. 
As many over OVAs, this one, too, is aimed at the manga readers and not the anime audience. 
 
Story: 8 
It is a very precise adaption from the manga. This goes for both OVAs. They both take place between two arcs in the manga, thus there is no thick plot but instead they show hilarious scenes from the everyday lifes of the characters which sometimes have a deeper meaning if put into the correct context. 
 
Art: 9 
The art is as good in the OVAs as it is in the anime series. 
No complaints here. 
 
Sound: 9 
Opening and Ending are great, the voices fit the characters. The OST is used throughout the OVAs in a fitting way. 
 
Character: 9 
Well, I absolutely adore most of Noragami's characters. They are very unique - which is shown best by Yato in these two twenty minute OVAs. Every action is just such a typical thing for him to do. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
I've loved it in the manga and I still love these scenes in the OVAs. The Second OVA was hilarious but sad at the same time, considering the previous events. 
 
Overall: 9 
It's nearly perfect, but - as expected of an OVA - it does not have any real plot. 
 
So, enjoy watching the Noragami OVAs, guys~

    Story and Characters 
It of course picks up exactly where the Sanctuary oavs leave off. This time as opposed to the Gold Saints being the central focus, the main featured characters in this series are Seiya and Shun as well as one certain Gold Saint I can't mention due to spoiler reasons in relation to the original TV series, though Hyoga and Shiryu aren't exaclty useless, they are still busy fighting their battles respective battles. And Ikki is still rarely present, but whatever presence he has will be overly significant to what happens in this story. The newer main villains that were introduced in the last oav such as Rhadmantys, are now part of the battlefield as well as a handful of other new characters. And who are some of these new characters? I feel that you have to see it to find out who some of them are, but I can tell you that some of these characters are bad ass. 
 
What also makes this story very great is that it expands the darker tone and atmosphere and still uses intriguing plot twists as it did in the Sanctuary Arc, but I thought what this installment offers I never saw coming many cosmos away. And the ending I thought was a very fitting and suited the themes of bravery, sacrafice, friendship, and brotherhood very well in the tradition of Saint Seiya.  
 
Art and Animation 
Well, the qualities that made the animation and coloring in the first oav is still present here. The lighting is still appropriate and I can't say much. The only negative thing I can say about the animation are the dead bodies serving as slaves to Hades. They look super cheap as hell, but in the end, they really don't matter. 
 
The new characters featured are really breathtaking to watch. Granted the diversity of the design for some of the main villains is getting weak, they all have their own unique traits and techniques. The features of the armors are appropriate with the underworld-hell theme. And of course there will be some interesting gimmick characters, though these charcters were kind of done before, they were featured in fillers of the original series, but this time, the characters with this kind of gimmick are a Kurumada-sensei original and he adds his own unique detail and feature to it.  
 
The quality of the action is still pretty awesome and the moves that will be demonstrated by the newer characters are very cool and the namings sound kind of weird, but this is one of those instances where such bizarre Engrish phrases can be sweet.  
 
Music and Voice Acting  
The most controversial thing about this anime is the changing of the seiyuus from the Bronze Saints and Athena. Apparently, Kurumada-sensei wanted to change everyone except Furuya Tooru because he thought they were too old for their roles, but the only exception is Suzuoki Hirotaka who passed away between the releases of the Sanctuary and Inferno oavs. I heard he especially wanted to change Shun's original voice actor Horikawa Ryo. Furuya Tooru wanted everyone to stay aboard, and he decided to quit. The fans were very angry about this and tried to petition to Kurumada-sensei to not go with this change, and it got severe to the point where Kurumada-sensei got his legal team to speak on behalf of him to accept the changes.  
 
As for the ""too old excuse,"" I think it's flatout bullshit. Furuya Tooru still plays 15 year old Amuro in the new Gundam games and so on. Horikawa Ryo I thought still did an excellent job in playing Shun in the Sanctuary Chapter. I always loved the tone and the articulation he brought to the character. And I can't speak much for Shiryu's and Hyoga's new seiyuus since they weren't featured enough or gave a certain kind of performance in which I felt they could capture what I think is the essence of their characters. So who was replaced you might ask? Seiya is now played by Morita Masakazu, who might know as the voice of Kurosawa Ichigo from Bleach. But he was casted as Seiya because Kurumada-sensei had him casted as Takane Ryuuji, the main character in the anime adaptation of his first manga, Ring ni kakero. I can agree that Morita does sound appropriately youthful and brings a distinctive kind of energy to the role of Seiya in which it does suit his character, but I think he really lacks this dignified-heroic quality in his voice that Furuya Tooru has and I don't think he comes across as leaderlike.  
 
But the new voice actor who really won me over was Shun's, Kazuya Yuuta. The performance that had me convinced was in the second episode about when he ""testifies"" to the judge about what sins he's committed and how sin is natural in human nature for such and such reason. He really showed the emotion and compassion necessary that defines the Shun character and I was able to embrace him with that. The only problem I have with the voice is his pitch. It's soft, but yet still high, while with the original performance by Horikawa, it had the low voice where you could tell that he was a man despite his very feminine appearence. Another performance I liked was Konishi Katsuyuki as Ikki. I thought he captured the character well in his own way by being the lone wolf who sticks out and being the ""I do things my own way"" kind of guy.  
 
The new opening theme featured is Megami no Senshi by Marina Del Ray, who also sings Asu He No Toushi, the opening theme to Ring ni Kakero. The brief church organs that play is very dark and gets you hooked and then all of a sudden the guitars play and you see the saints running at the screen along with the title in the background and you got something that lives up to the original theme song, Pegasus Fantasy. In comaprison to that song, it's still pretty sweet hard rock, but it has a certain kind of diversity with the intensity that it has with being gloomy, but yet there is still hope. The imagery, the panning, and the sound effects that go with the panning just add so much to it and I must say that the quality sometimes makes me argue with myself of which is the better theme song between the old and new one. So the opening theme itself is an instant winner.  
 
The background music is actually still the same so I can't say much about it that I haven't already have said in my previous reviews.  
 
Overall 
This OAV will have you pumped up for the next oav and the true ending to the original manga of Saint Seiya. If you want plot twists, then you got what I think is one of the best plot twists in anime history

    The middle act of the Hades Arc, Inferno, is a major step down from Sanctuary in almost every way.  
 
Whilst quickly going through many of the battles and several Celestial Star Spectres quickly being diposed of allows it to stand out and be less repetitive when it comes to combat with it's side villains than the Poseidon Arc was, it also makes them a major disappointment when Terrestrial Star Spectres such as Myu proved a genuine threat to the Gold Saints. Instead of being a true step up in power, only the Judges, Pharaoh and Rhadamanthys' underlings prove much of a genuine threat. The reveal of Shun's secret was an interesting twist that explained how he survived his fatal battle with Aphrodite, but it came without foreshadowing from previous arcs and Ikki's lack of knowledge on it was from as poor a plot device as amnesia. Beyond that, the plot was as typical of Saint Seiya Arcs. 
It did have some interest in the setting with it being a mix of both the Greek Underworld and Hell as described in Dante's Divine Comedy, which lead to some nice creative liberties in locations and the theme of life being finite and thus precious was a decent way of making the idea of holding onto hope less generic than usual. However, the regular lives of the Spectres weren't explored enough for the setting to be more than pretty backgrounds and the theme of hope and finite life weren't explored too deep, just being a reiteration of Shaka's words in the first act of this arc. 
 
The characters at least make up for this somewhat. While most of the villains within the arc were bland loyal henchmen, Pharaoh at least had some goals beyond serving Hades that allowed him to at least be more engaging than most of the Marina from the previous arc. Hades also carried himself well in displaying the power of a God, far better than Poseidon did in the previous arc where he was defeated twice by Gold Saints. As for the heroes, allowing Kanon and Orphe to have their moments to shine was a breath of fresh air after having two arcs of the Bronze Saints hogging all the glory and prevents it from becoming repetitive. Kanon VS Rhadamanthys also had some pretty good build up in the formation of a rivalry between them. Speaking of the Gold Saints such as Kanon, the ending of this 2nd act carries far more consequence and emotion than any of the previous arcs combined. That said, the character appeal is enough to even out the disappointing elements of the plot and make the writing for this arc average overall. 
 
As for the more superficial elements, even these strong points for the series went a step below it's predecessor. While the still pieces of art remain as good as prior, the animation became far more limited with many shots being reused constantly and character movement becoming far less fluid. Even the sound was a step down from before as while the soundtrack remains unchanged and as great as ever, the changes in several seiyuu such as all of the Bronze Saints was something that would be offputting for returning fans who had grown so accustomed to the iconic deliveries of Toru Furuya or Ryo Horikawa, especially when many of the seiyuu had yet to fully become accustomed to their roles.  
 
That said, Inferno is a step down from Sanctuary, though still has it's moments to warrant continuing the series to it's climax.

    ""A dirty stray cat"" 
 
Story (10): This is one of the most sober animes I've seen. In a quietly daily basis, it presents you with a society filled with hardship, cruelty, injustice and yet, people struggling to survive between cynicism, indiference and a little bit of hope, as fragile as a candle light. 
 
Art (10): The art is very particular and mesmerizing. This is one of my favorite aspects of the anime. It suits the entire feeling of the characters and story perfectly: lazy deep eyes, expresive innocent eyes, mouths that look like translucent sketches of expression, gorgeous dark landscapes... not mentioning the atenttion to detail the artists paid to develope parts of the story without needing to use dialogue. 
 
Sound (9.5): Although I'd have liked the op and ending to have a more traditional sound, the sound as a whole does an excellent work, sometimes to simply acompany the scenery. And other times, to tell in a subtle way a whole different story, when you are only watching two people drinking. 
 
Character (10): The characters are very well developed, they are not stereotypes, you can really see flesh and bones here. From the straight forward Masa, to the enigmatic Ichi, they all have a very rich inner life, that moves their actions and reactions in very particular ways. Showing the greys in white and black, or perhaps; turning from black to white and from white to black over and over. 
 
Enjoyment (10): Well, I got to tell you, if you don't enjoy slow paced animes or expect to see fighting, well... you might not enjoy it too much, but give it a chance, this is a real psychological/artistic candy. 
 
Overall (10): I'd really suggest you to watch it, this is a nice piece of work, artistically and philosophically. I mean, just watching the way the titles were chosen made me chuckle with pleassure.

    For an anime with a samurai and a criminal gang you would expect an action packed series, however, instead it is slow moving focusing on the characters rather than hiding its flaws behind action and copious amounts of blood 
 
Saraiya Goyou follows an unemployed yet highly skilled samurai, Masa, in the Edo period who because he has a personality that is difficult to warm to is unable to hold down a job or make friends. A chance meeting with the mysterious Yaichi, the leader of the criminal gang House of the Five Leaves, leads to a one-off job as a body guard for a ransom drop for a kidnapping the House of the Fives Leaves did. Surprising Yaichi with is skill with a sword Masa is then chased by Yaichi to join the House of the Five Leaves.  
 
As progress through the series we see Masa, although never actually officially join the House of the Five Leaves, help the gang with various kidnappings and return find a sense of belonging, regular work and close friends in the members of the House of the Five Leaves all of whom have a reason to be grateful to Yaichi. However, Yaichi remains an enigma. Who is he, where is he from and why did he start the House of the Five Leaves. Masa attempts to find out making him a danger to Yaichi. 
 
Although the story is entertaining despite its slow pace is engaging with interesting and likable albeit somewhat shady characters there is a flaw with the direction which lets it down. We begin with the focus on Masa then suddenly there is a huge jump to a focus on Yaichi. Now I don't know if this was a production decision where they decided a series longer than 12 episodes wouldn't work but it affects the flow of the story and has a negative affect on the story where I never really got too interested in learning about Yaichi's background. 
 
I can't write a review of Saraiya Goyou without going into detail about the animation. Great animation is about detail and the background artwork in Saraiya Goyou is absolutely stunning whether it is the simplicity of a Japanese house or the wide Japanese landscape there is so much attention to detail. The use of colours is even thought about  with darker colours used for night scenes and lighter colours for during the day.  
 
With such detailed background they have been able to get away with some unusual and simplistic character designs with their wide mouths which never seem to move when they talk.  
 
The music sets the mood well and the opening song is very good putting you in the right mood to watch the series. 
 
Despite its problems with the big change in focus of the story Saraiya Goyou works very well and is worth watching for the animation alone.

    While indubitably a good one, this anime might not be just everyone's cup of tea. Speaking of cups of tea, Saraiya Goyou is very much like a good cup of tea on a winter's evening, when you're snuggled up in a chair with a warm blanket and a good book. It's a cup of green tea, gently warming your freezing palms, with delicate yet sweet taste and subtle fragrance.  
 
While one may call it slow-paced, and there's not much action to be seen there, its beauty lies precisely in its slow, meditative storytelling. It's a genuine drama in its portrayal of people with unique circumstances, how their fates, pasts, motivations, hopes and fears cross, clash, grow together. It's a show about forgiveness and reconciliation, with the world and with yourself, a show about how everyone starts out with different dreams and goals but, in the end, is just searching for a place in this world that they can call their own, about how letting people in and loving people is so hard, how it doesn't happen smoothly or easily, but how when it does happen, it's what matters most. It's a show about how what one may perceive as one's grave fault may very well be one's merit. It's a great slice-of-life in a historical setting of late Edo period (for those who are studying Japanese, it gives a nice sample of Edo period dialects), showing the frailties of everyday life and how unimportant and mundane things are often the best in life. One of the greatest strenghts of Saraiya Goyou is that while this is a show featuring samurai, yakuza and geisha, kidnappings and (some) swordfighting, it successfully escapes the tropes that usually go with it all. It discards the bombastic, bathos-laden, overly dramatic, move-flashing, testosterone-flaring, tear-jerking, over-the-top moves for a softer storytelling which makes everything a lot more believable, relatable, and manages to deliver a lot of impact. To continue the drinks analogy I started, it might be like a cocktail in a way: deceptively light and sweet, but packing a punch when you cease to expect it. 
 
The art style is... unusual, especially the character design with angular faces and weird rectangular eyes. The color palette is muted, with a lot of greys, browns, yellows and blacks, underscoring the overall subdued atmosphere of the show. Yet let that not scare you away: the backs are drawn beautifully, you get treated to realistic representations of Edo street life and architecture, and character design, if not always easy on the eye, grows on you over time and is a nice change of pace from the stereotypical huge-eyed brightly-colored too smooth almost-no-nose faces you see everywhere lately. It adds this nice, tingling touch of uniqueness to the show. 
 
The sound is absolutely fantastic. I will no doubt buy the soundtrack for Saraiya Goyou given the oppotunity. The score is heavily influenced by traditional Japanese music, using many traditional instruments, but retains a modern feel to it. It is very atmosperic, brimming with emotion, and compliments the action perfectly. Not only the music is outstanding, but the VAs did a damn good job too, conveying the complicated characters and their emotions perfectly. Masanosuke is completely believable with his soft, low voice, and Yaichi shines with his contolled intonations.  
 
The characters are the core and the driving force of this show, so, naturally, for the show to work, they have to be good, and they are indeed. It's a shame that the show contains only 12 episodes, because there is not enough time to provide a proper background and exposition for everyone, but it's getting to know the cast and seeing them interact, clash, soothe and change each other that is the most enjoyable. The tones of their voices, their clothing, the faces and poses they make, their silences and gazes even, there's a lot more to the characters than just what they say, and it looks way more real and interesting than endless dialogues or narration. It's a shame that not everyone gets to shine, but everyone gets a unique personality constructed with love and care. 
 
If you like fast pacing and action, this is not something for you. But if you're looking for a deep story with a lot of character development, room for thought and emotion, this is definitely something for you. This story might make you reconsider your own life - for, really, how many small coincidences, meetings, word exchanges that seemingly mean nothing occur every day in your life? You might not know it yet, but it is those small meaningless things that make up our lives and that weave the threads that will someday show bright and strong on the tapestry of your life. What is later perceived as fate always begins small and insignificant. This show teaches one to treasure it.

     The story is set in Edo period Japan, where a highly skilled but highly gullible and unreliable samurai is finding trouble securing a job as a bodyguard. The starving ""ronin"" soon catches the attention of the misterious and charismatic leader of a local criminal gang known as the ""Five Leaves Gang"" who hires him to serve as his bodyguard and soon, starts persuading him into officialy joining the gang. Though reluctant at first, the samurai ends up joining the gang, partly due to his critical financial situation but also due to his growing interest in the gang and its members; as time goes by and their relationship deepens he discovers that there's more to each member than meets the eye, especialy the always elusive and misterious leader. 
The beauty of this anime isn't in its art style which accurately depicts the landscapes of feudal japan to the tiniest detail; or in the beautiful music which is a perfect mixture of contemporary and classical japonese; its in the characters and their development. That is the keyword in this anime, development. The pace in which this anime progresses is absolutely perfect, the pieces start falling into place at the perfect timing, resulting in a smooth and crescent experience that, just like a roller coaster, will carry you softly to the top only to send you crashing down to the floor.  
Those are the strongest points of animes such as House of Five Leaves, and don't misjudge, I'm not saying that crazy fantasy, battle, oriented, superpower, samurai stories aren't good; most of my favorite animes fall into those categories. What I'm saying is that there are such a vast collection of these types of manga already, and that is precisely what makes more obscure, down to earth animes like House of Five Leaves such a special and unique genre. So give it a chance, you won't fall in love with it at the first sight, but talk to me once the ride is over.

    Now don't get me wrong by looking at the mark i gave this anime. On my scale, 7 is very high, way above average. And Saraiya Goyou really is just that. It is not a masterpiece, or even close to that, but it beats the majority of the anime we get to watch.  
 
The story is the best part of this anime. It is not linear. Even though it is told in a chronological order with a few flashbacks, you can't discern the series of events till the very end. And even then, when you can remember all of the events, and put them together systematically, the story that appears in front of your eyes is not generic or simple. It involves a lot of completely different and unique characters. And they are unique compared not only with each other but with the whole anime medium. A sissy skilled samurai, a prostitute with a sense of justice and so on. While some characters might seem generic when you first get to know them, they appear to be quite original and well developed later on in the show. Yaichi could be a good example of that. A mysterious and cool chick magnet who is also awesomely skilled in fighting. But later on, we get more development on him and the real truth is revealed. But if we consider character development as a whole, I'd say it's not exemplary. I've seen better and deeper characters, but like anime, it's way above average. 
 
The art might repel a lot of potential viewers, but I liked it. A lot. First of all, it's very original. I don't think there are any more anime with such art. But if we take a closer look, it's only the characters that are drawn originally. They have goofy eyes an such, but it kind of adds up to the whole atmosphere. However, if you look at the background, and things around the  characters, you will see awesomeness. Detail everywhere, textures, lighting - everything. It was really spectacular. 
 
Another aspect of this anime that I loved a lot, is it's sound track. It was amazing. It built up such a relaxing mood. And if we add it together with the soothing coloring of the anime, we might just fall asleep watching it. The music itself was not something spectacular. I would not download and listen to like a song. But what makes it good in the anime is the matches with everything else. 
 
I enjoyed watching Saraiya Goyou. It did not make my brain melt, it let me relax after a hard day and just forget the world around me. But an important thing is that you have to catch every little detail there is to fully understand the story. So a complete relaxation is not an option. You should just turn of your muscles and let your mind do the work. 
 
To sum up, Saraiya Goyou is a fresh whiff of air among all the crap we get. I wish we could watch more anime like this. But then again, it is not and it won't be popular for quite some time and therefore, we should not be expecting that. That's why people who like such intelligent anime with no fan service, dumb action scenes and generic storylines and characters should not miss any of the good ones like House of the Five Leaves.

    When you think of Samurai, what images flash into your mind first? Courageous warriors clad in their traditional hakama? Fierce sword fights to the death? Or maybe a lifelong journey to achieve some form of enlightenment? Saraiya Goyou, or The House of Five Leaves (I’ll refer to the show as “Goyou” for the rest of the review), is none of these. In fact, it doesn’t come close to anything our culture has widely perceived about the behaviors of these swordsmen.  
 
Story (8/10): 
 
Akitsu “Masa” Masanosuke is a ronin, or a masterless samurai, who lives in Edo period of Japanese history (a time period that lasted from the early 1600’s to the late 1800’s). Despite his swordsmanship skills and his humble personality, Masa never seems to be able to hold down a secure job as a bodyguard. His slightly naïve nature and aloof presence is his Achilles heel, and he often finds himself being fired because of them. One day, after being fired from yet another job, Masa runs into a charismatic, white-haired individual only known to the viewers as Yaichi. To Masa’s dismay, Yaichi beings to gain interest in Masa’s character and offers him a bodyguard position. However, it doesn’t take long for Masa to realize what he’s getting himself into. Yaichi reveals himself as the leader of the mysterious group, “The Five Leaves”(Goyou), and he expresses his desire to admit Masa as a new member. 
 
What plays out from here is a bit odd. 
 
It’s extremely difficult to pinpoint a specific genre for the series, since the story plays out as a sort of pseudo-mystery that has light dose of drama, slice of life, and very limited action. With that said, the show is definitely not what one would expect from any samurai show. It is heavy on dialogue, and it relies on its characters to drive its plot rather than relying on a coherent storyline. Although the show does work with the aforementioned “mystery” through carefully placed flashbacks or hints through conversations, there really isn’t much else when it comes to direction.  
 
However, this is what makes Goyou such a unique and entertaining experience. It’s different to a point that the premise becomes a risky task to execute well, but it really doesn’t do anything noticeably wrong. Throughout the series, we get to learn a good amount about the show’s main cast, and the way we find out about each individual’s pasts and reasons behind joining Goyou comes off naturally, without any unnecessary drama or nonsensical development. Unfortunately, that is the extent to its unique nature. Despite providing such a different experience, the series doesn’t do anything in particular to “wow” viewers. As a result, the series will draw a niche crowd, but it will likely be doomed for obscurity. Nonetheless, the story of Goyou relies on its execution, and it definitely delivers. It does just enough to keep an interested viewer interested, but it doesn’t go the extra mile to draw in a larger crowd.  
 
Art (8.5/10):  
 
Manglobe has always been a studio that doesn’t shy away from taking risks with its art style, and Goyou is no exception to this pattern. Unlike the studio’s other samurai-related show, Samurai Champloo, the atmosphere of Goyou gives off a heavy, melancholic feel. Covering a wide variety of locales from the Edo countryside to its red light districts, the richness of the setting is often overlooked due to this gloomy atmosphere. As a result, the color palette limits itself to duller colors in order to consistently fit the almost depressing setting.  
Matching this sullen tone are the character designs of our main cast. Characterized by their detached stares and wide mouths, the designs aren’t the prettiest anime have to offer, but they surprisingly fit the equally sullen environment of the series. Animation is decent throughout the series, but it doesn’t really stand out (mostly due to the lack of sword fights, the most common form of showing off animation skill in a samurai-related anime). As a whole, the art and animation of Goyou is solid. Defined by its uniquely dull (sounds counterintuitive, I know) atmosphere, Goyou makes its visual achievements noticeable and appreciated.  
 
Sound (9.5/10): 
 
At this point, I should stop trying to doubt Manglobe’s ability at composing quality soundtracks that match the show perfectly. The OST of Goyou is comprised of 26 tracks, most of which enhance the gloominess of an already dreary, dreamlike atmosphere. Tracks like “Umaku Ikusa” give the viewer a sense of regret, melodic yet haunting. Such tracks are amongst the most common in the OST, with the anime’s main theme of the same name as the title seem almost like a tango remix of the aforementioned track. Even the more lighthearted tracks such as “Chokko Tokurri” possess the same melancholic tone as the others, despite its attempts at being a bit more upbeat. Despite being the near perfect addition to the technical set of Goyou, the OST’s limited diversity in tracks is a flaw that, although doesn’t deter much from the overall experience, is still a noticeable flaw. 
 
The opening sequence, Sign of Love, is in a genre probably somewhere in between electronic pop or trance that, although does not fit the time period of the series at all, is still a very catchy and uncharacteristically upbeat song that surprisingly, works very well with the anime. The ending, All I need is…, plays out similarly to the opening but is a bit more generic and forgettable. Voice acting is cast well in general, with each voice seeming almost reluctant to play the role. However, the disinterested tone of each voice is again a characteristic of the series that after a while, I just began to simply accept. Sometimes the voices seem as if they are being performed through a filter, which adds to the atmosphere.  
 
Overall, the sound set of Goyou is both strong and memorable. With few and almost unavoidable flaws, everything from the OST to the voice acting is done with the utmost attention to detail.  
 
Character (9/10): 
 
If there is any other category that stands out in Goyou as much as its OST, it’s the amount of depth put into its characters. The series boasts a very strong cast that, although may seem to be dull at first, are all properly fleshed out and have distinct personalities. From the humble and awkward Masa to the cynical, yet caring Ume, each character’s persona is built off of well-developed backstory and feasible interactions. What really surprised me other than the diversity and odd likeability of each character was that each individual had a certain human aspect to them. Every character is multifaceted, and it’s hard to describe them using a simple archetypal word or phrase. The series does a wonderful job at making the characters interesting enough to not only drive the series, but to provide the needed depth in order to make the overall experience a well-planned out one.  
 
However, it’s this very mature handling that somewhat dooms the cast. Despite the very human approach at developing and reasoning out the motives of each character, the results might be blander than a typical viewer would expect. To put an example to this reasoning, viewers won’t remember a character like Yaichi as much as they will remember a character like Lelouch (Code Geass). Despite both being charismatic leaders of their respective “groups,” there’s no “selling point” to the cast other than their realness. Although this is by no means a fatal flaw, it’s an unavoidable gaffe that unfortunately just happened to hurt the experience.  
 
Nonetheless, even the lack of flashiness in the cast isn’t enough to discredit the thorough characterization and overall quality of the character crew. Although you won’t be seeing Masa or Yaichi skyrocketing to the top of the favorite characters list on this site, you will appreciate the care put into their personalities.  
 
Enjoyment (8.5/10): 
 
I’m a sucker for slower paced shows because I love kicking back after a hectic day to slow things down. Goyou does just that, but it doesn’t bore you to death doing so. As stated in previous sections, the story has some drive and direction and keeps it present enough to keep a viewer slightly pulled into the experience. Although it’s by no means a psychological thriller, the languid pacing was a welcome change of pace that I happened to enjoy a good deal. Although I had no problem getting through the series, if you’re walking in expecting something like Samurai Champloo, you’ll definitely be disappointed. 
 
Overall: 
 
At the end of the day, Saraiya Goyou is a thankless anime. Despite its excellent execution of multiple categories, its achievements will likely be as hidden and humbled as is Masa’s personality. It’s aimed at a rather niche crowd, but it does a great job at satiating that crowd’s desires. Nevertheless, I would urge viewers to give Saraiya Goyou a try if you’re willing to try something pleasantly different.  
 
Average score: 8.7/10  
Weighted score: 7/10 (Liked it, recommended)

    First of all, some people seem dissapointed in this series due to its lack of action. Don't let the edo setting fool you, this is no samurai epic. It's not about fights and blood, it's more interesting than that. 
 
Story 8/10. 
 
Our hero is a bit of a pussy. He's a sumurai, but so unintimidating that he can barely hold his head up without running away. His hidden skill rarely surfaces, but somehow he still manages to impress a local bandit enough to be invited into his group. Forced to betray his morals due to poverty, he befriends the members and joins their kidnapping ranks. 
 
So starts the series. Later episodes focus on the leader of the gang, Yaichi, and his mysterious personality. Along the way the other members are also exposed in a somewhat limited fashion. 
 
It's all done very nicely and extraordinarily elegantly. 
 
Animation 9/10. 
 
The subtlety of the plot's delivery is only matched by the fabulously detailed, gorgeously believable backdrops. The edo-era wooden buildings are charmingly  stunning and accurate. The warmth of the lantern-lit streets and shops is exactly Japan, equal parts past and the best of the modern. Even in Tokyo you can find little streets illuminated only by lanterns, lined with wooden buildings. If and when you do, you'll be reminded of the sumptuous images from the House of Five Leaves. 
 
The character designs are also excellent. One of the big failing points in modern anime is the lack of original (or even particularly convincing) facial expressions. Natsume Ono creates faces with a grown-up eye towards realism without pushing too hard. The elongated mouths and droopy eyes, both with recognisable Japanese features, portray emotion far more convincingly than the vast majority of other efforts, and need massive credit for that. 
 
Sound 8.5/10. 
 
The music was so good and I'm so rarely impressed by anime soundtracks that I could barely focus on anything else. The tunes are varied, but invariably upbeat and original. Predominantly traditional instruments with more modern beats; every track was great. 
 
The Japanese seiyuu did a good job, too. 
 
The OP and ED are rubbish, however. I see what they were trying to do, but it failed. The result was like putting Geri Halliwell's version of ""It's Raining men"" at the start of Monster, finishing with Lionel Richie's ""Hello"". 
 
Characters 7.5/10. 
 
Although I did like them, I would have liked to see a lot more development all round, and especially from the promising female characters. The lead could also have done with being slightly less of a pussy. A dimension of the storytelling I also would have improved would be the lead actually being the lead at all. Seeing as how Masanosuke's part wasn't actually as big or significant as it was initially presented to be, I would have started from the perspective of the gang first. In this way perhaps we wouldn't have expected him to deliver where he ultimately didn't. 
 
One character I was impressed with, however, was Matsukichi. A tenderly treated vision of depression. 
 
Overall 8.2/10. 
 
Very good series. Though not particularly inspiring in its premise, something happens to this anime which makes it attract and engage the viewer (i.e. me) surprisingly well. I can only call it the sum of its parts. The art, firstly, draws an interest both in backdrop and character; the music chipperly increases momentum, and the sly story ties it all together in a charming and satisfyingly dignified package. 
 
Not a lot happens, and it's hard to see this series as anything other than an introduction to something longer (despite its low ratings let's hope we can see more manga-material animated), and as that it is an excellent piece of TV. A longer, faster-paced sequel would be an great way to continue this anime.

    House of Five Leaves is an utterly mesmerizing Samurai drama that follows the dealings of a gang of thieves called Five Leaves in Edo Japan, who focus on kidnapping and ransom to make a profit. Despite the intriguing premise the show sadly went overlooked by most at the time of its release. This is likely due to the focus on dialogue and character interaction rather than swordplay and large-scale fights. It's a real shame too because the characters themselves are really something to behold.  
 
 Each member of the Five Leaves gang receives a small character arc that delves into their motivations and attitudes towards thievery. The show constantly explores the idea of when it is and isn't okay to commit a crime. Some are earning money to support another, others are following a code of loyalty, but each of the five members has their reasons. The audience is really allowed to reflect on what they would do in the situations of these characters and that is why the drama is so easy to resonate with. House of Five Leaves understands the importance of family, and the limits one would go through to maintain a relationship. The fear of isolation looms over everyone in our cast, and abandonment is a demon that can inflict scars deeper than those on one's skin.  
 
 These scars come to light little by little through the character Yaichi. A lot of times mystery-box characters are handled poorly because they're too distant to care for, but in Yaichi's case his cool composure and mysterious aura just add to his overwhelming charisma. He is drawn with a long face and snake-like eyes, which speaks volumes about his character's constant scheming. His distance actually makes him all that much more intriguing, and it fits very realistically within the realms of his character considering his history, which all comes full circle in the show's very emotional finale.  
 
 That isn't to diminish the rest of the cast however. The main character Masanosuke is clearly depressed and suffers from social anxiety, but he never wallows in self-loathing and is always doing his best to better himself which makes him extremely likable and relatable. His depression never overpowers the show however, as it's handled in such a subtle way that it blends into the background, which keeps the tone from getting too morbid. His honest and innocent yet cowardly nature gives him great chemistry with the aforementioned Yaichi, who acts as his composed and secretive and foil. Masanosuke also has a nice dynamic with a cop named Yagi, who acts as somewhat of a mentor figure to him, and allows Masanosuke to discover a lot about himself. His gradual growth towards the Five Leaves members is something really pleasant to watch, as by the end it feels like they've created their own little family inside Ume's bar.  
 
 While Take, the girl of the group, got the short end of the stick in terms of screen-time, (as she is the only one who isn't fleshed out through an arc) she and the other members add some very valuable life into the series. House of Five Leaves opts for a very relaxed and slow paced atmosphere rather than one of tension and excitement. Despite its slow burn feel the show never becomes dull due to the brilliant character interaction. In fact, this atmosphere gives the show a very unique identity. It exudes the same feelings one would receive sitting by the fire, and smoking a pipe as the clouds float gently through the sky, and the feeling is sold through its masterful presentation.  
 
 The mystery and serenity generated by the music harken back to a simpler Japanese time, while the earthy yet faded colour pallet simultaneously captures the clouded and distant minds of the characters as well as the natural beauty of the time period. Characters are designed with unnatural eyes and triangular noses, creating a feeling of unease; a feeling that something is clearly not right with these people.  
 
 This really shows how well directed the series is. There are no long bouts of exposition or inner monologues used to tell the story. Instead, the show utilizes the environment to give itself depth. Little things like curtains creating barriers between characters, wide shots displaying isolation, or dark lighting conveying scheming and negativity. It's these little nuggets of cinematic expression that keep House of Five Leaves engaging.  
 
 The biggest issue I have with the series is the ending. It is very emotional ride and even has a clever throwback to the first episode, but there is a lack of closure regarding Masanosuke. I would've liked to see a more distinctive change in his attitude, and while it seems like he's found his place in life amongst Five Leaves, he hasn't fully worked through his social awkwardness. That said, the other character arcs were all tied up nicely, and for a show so small in scale the ending is satisfyingly humble.  
 
 Overall House of Five Leaves is a very rewarding experience with a very tranquilizing atmosphere and a well written and mature cast of characters. I would recommend it to almost anyone as the drama has such a wide appeal, but if you're in the market for raw spectacle then you should look elsewhere.

    Saraiya Goyou is a distinctive, mature work that takes a refreshingly honest look at the Edo period, romanticising it in the only sense it should be idealised; an aesthetic sense. We follow an oddly honourable band of kidnappers in Japan’s Feudal age. Yaichi, the leader of this group, the Saraiya Goyou, and the bashful ronin that becomes involved with them, Matsu, are the central characters. The pace of the series is intentionally slow, allowing it to be a completely character driven, subtle, perfectly crafted narrative. If you are looking an anime that is  clash and slash, hard rock- look elsewhere; this is a skilful, meandering zither solo. 
 
Artwork 8/10 
The first aspect of the series that might catch your attention may be the artwork. It has a Ukiyo quality to it; perfectly reflecting the Japanese artwork created at the time the story is set. This woodblock-print style (from which all anime styles have descended), set against an accordion score that would be more at home in 1920s France, welcomingly but unexpectedly settles you into this distant time and place. The art direction lets the series down somewhat; though it’s good, it isn’t superb. 
 
Character 10/10 
Character truly does drive the series and though every character is a well rounded and unique, three-dimensional person, much of the series centers on the interaction between two characters in particular. Little more need be said than that one has naïve, circular pupils that sit in his saucer shaped eyes, while the other has small, perceptive, green globes that peer out from behind intelligent slits with quiet, ambivalent menace.  
 
Story 9/10. 
The plot is by no means spoon fed to the viewer, the majority of the important plot points are in fact left only implicit. The story itself is, however, only as complex as an engaging narrative need be. The perceptive viewer is always given enough information to see one step ahead of the story, but never beyond that to where the real questions lie. Japanese media doesn’t pander to its audience and is often as complex as the writers choose it to be, but narratives like Saraiya Goyou show that how powerful a narrative is has no relation with its complexity.

    After seeing the last episode, I've now added this anime to my top 5 favorites. 
 
The first word I'd use to describe it is ""quirky.""  The art style is quirky, the music is quirky, and so are the characters. 
 
A shy, sensitive, and naive samurai (Masa) who can't keep a job is hired to be a bodyguard for the boss of a small gang called The Five Leaves.  The boss (Yaichi) is an utter mystery to most of the other characters, especially Masa.  At the heart of the story is Masa discovering who Yaichi really is.  And the need each human has: the need to be loved and wanted. 
 
I watched this anime as it was coming out.  I gave it a rating of 8 until the very last episode.  The ending was so good, I had to raise it to 10.  It really packed a punch, and gave me a lump in the throat. 
 
I began watching it because of the style.  I LOVED the quirkiness of the art, and the music.  And the beauty of the animation in general, which has a sort of dark, film noir-ish look.  The sets and backgrounds are beautifully realistic, albeit the general color scheme is natural colors (browns, black).  It also takes place in winter, with chilly clear days, and no foliage but for the red-leafed maples.  At the end comes the frost and snow. 
 
I appreciated that it's easy to tell which scenes are flashbacks.  They are green-tinted. 
 
And the music is quirky (think of the music in xxxHolic; I'd call that quirky too) just with a folk-music style. 
 
As I said, it was the style that hooked me.  But then I started to like Masa.  Or identify with him.  He has to come to grips with his social awkwardness, and decide if he really wants to work with an illegal gang.  He envys Yaichi and his contentedness, and hopes that attitude will rub off on himself.  ""I wish I could smile like you do,"" he tells Yaichi. 
 
As the series nears the end, we begin to discover clues about who the enigmatic Yaichi really is; this man who goes about with an air of ease, sliding through life, carrying his constant smirk.  Masa begins to delve into Yaichi's past, despite warnings to not get involved with him.  And Masa discovers that the most influential things in a person's life often hinge on the simplest things.  One choice by one person can forever change someone's life: for good, or evil; for happiness, or for tragedy.  And that even the strongest-seeming person has the same needs and vulnerabilities that everyone else does. 
 
The only detraction for me was keeping track of the characters.  I have to admit that I have a hard time remembering Japanese names.  And since this is supposed to be fairly realistic historical Japan, the characters look realistic.  They don't have purple or red hair to help you tell them apart.    So I kept mistaking some of the characters for others.  Yaichi is the only exception--the creators make him really stand out.   
 
The overall feel of this anime is slice-of-life.  The pacing is pretty slow.  This is a drama.  But it doesn't drag too long, since it's only 12 episodes.  If you ONLY like action, romance, or conventional anime styles, it probably isn't for you.  But if you're willing to relax, take it easy, be sensitive, and appreciate something different, I definitely recommend it! 
 
EDIT: After watching it a second time, I wanted to share another thought.  It's as if the entire series was created for the sake of the final 5 minutes of the very last episode.  Nay, for the last 30 seconds.  Everything builds up to that very final scene.  As I said before, it packed a punch.  And it was a lot easier to keep track of who's who the second time around. 
 
And again, this series is pure drama, and rides on emotions and human interaction.  If that doesn't interest you, you probably won't enjoy it.

    Contrary to popular belief this anime is not calming...If anything it made me angry at how annoying and pathetic the protagonist is.  In fact he is so pitiful that nothing ever progresses in the plot.  
 
The one good thing about Saraiya-goyou is its unique art style. Saraiya-goyou is set during the Edo period in Japan and the art style is sort of a modern reflection of the art style from that period. Unfortunately I would never watch or recommend  an anime solely for the artwork so if you are thinking of watching it disregard this paragraph and move on. 
 
I understand some people are going to say &quot;But I really just want to watch calming anime and I&#039;ve heard that this fits thats description...&quot; As I have said above, that statement is horridly incorrect, its not calming...only tiresome and dull. If you want something calming, watch Aria.

    Story & Characters: 9 
A rather timid and shy samurai, Masa, comes across a yakuza, Yaichi. For the first time he isn't ridiculed for the frightening gap between his personality and occupation and is offered a job. When Yaichi notices Masa really has skills he tries to pull him into the Yakuza.  
This is a realistic story about how someone gets sucked into a yakuza group, and about becoming 'nakama'. While Masa struggles with his own demons he gets accepted by the 4 members of Sarai-ya Goyō. 
Within these twelve episodes we get to know fragments of their past and how Sarai-ya Goyō came to be.  
 
Art: 8 
The backgrounds are done beautiful. This is a style looks drawn. The faces of the characters are ...not realistic. Watching the anime however, it all fits. When I looked into it I found out those faces were typical for the mangaka's (Natsume Ono's) work. 
 
Sound: 9 
The opening tune was a shock to me. Some electrical beat for an anime placed in the Edo era? WTF?! After a few episodes I've come to like it and found out the songtekst couldn't be more fitting.  
Overal the sound is nicely done. The rain pours realistic, floor boards that make sounds etc. The music is fitting to the scene and the voice actors really seem to fit their characters.  
 
Enjoyment: 9 
For the very first time I have come across a seinen anime that has adult characters without flashy fighting moves. The story is simple and has a nice slow pace. Watching a realistic, slice of life, yakuza story without unnecessary violence and all that jazz? It really is possible. The way awkward emotions are conveyed is also nicely portrayed. 
 
Overall: 9 
Looking at the whole picture it is a story that is nicely set and really grabbed my attention. This is the first time I went ballistic searching for the manga after watching only the very first episode. This anime really grabbed my attention.

    This is a most perplexing anime, one that waits until the end to tie everything together. It’s actually very boring at first, and what redeems it is that the show keeps throwing out little bits of exposition and development, keeping an interest going while moving at the pace of a turtle. I would expect most action-oriented and plot-oriented anime fans to be bored our of their skulls, and character-oriented anime fans to be frustrated at first.  
 
If you notice the details, it is even more perplexing. It is an extremely high quality anime, the art is in this strangely solemn style, where the characters all have very low set jaws, large empty eyes, and a sort of thick-stroked gauntness which is somehow extremely emotive (a mere shift of the eyes is enough to convey as much emotion as an gasp/cover mouth in surprise would in other anime). The quality of animation shows a good budget went into this. The incidental music is very fitting, although the OP/ED music is completely in a different style than anything else in the anime. Despite that, the OP/ED is very good and somehow refreshing.  
 
So, why all this effort to make such a boring anime? Well, the trick is, it isn’t actually like nothing is happening. It’s actually quite a tense anime, but the tensions aren’t revealed until the end. Throughout the series, lots of meaningless actions and gestures will go right under our noses if we aren’t paying attention, but in actuality if we had been paying better attention, we would have caught the tensions that these actions and gestures really conveyed. A sideways glance in episode 5 might have actually revealed what we learn in episode 9, and in that way, I’d have to rematch the series to be sure, but I think there wasn’t any such things as meaningless actions or gestures, that every thing had a purpose, and that’s part of what made this series great. 
 
I can’t talk too much about the ending, but suffice to say, it ties the anime up, reveals everything that had been under the surface up until then, and quite frankly the way the ending made the rest of the anime make sense was literary. So, beautiful art, literary story, good music... yeah, I’d say this anime is pretty good :)

    Saraiya Goyou is a very sedate work that received less attention than the noitaminA time slot generally receives, and was something of a critical failure for this reason. Some people were put off by Saraiya Goyou, and more ignored it entirely.  
 
 A year after it's airing, the show deserves another look.  
 
 Story: 9 
 Sairaya Goyou's story is understated and slow paced, with little of the action that might be expected from a period samurai drama. Much is expressed through silence, and scenes unfold lazily, interspersed with brief segments of tension. The primary focus is on the mysterious Yaichi and his criminal associates, and the curiosity masterless Samurai Masa and Yaichi regard each other with. The plot is character-driven, and gradually learning more about the cast, their motivations and past becomes the primary focus of the anime.  
 
 Art: 8 
 The artwork is extremely distinct, to the point of being off-putting to those more comfortable with traditional anime styles. The illustration lends itself well to the moody, contemplative nature of the characters, and acts as an additional means of characterization for the cast.  Edo is lovingly displayed in a realistic manner. I found the strange art reminiscent of the Ukiyo-e and nostalgic of the period Saraiya Goyou sought to portray.  
 
 Sound: 7 
 The sounds are at once out of place and at purposes with Sairaya Goyou's feel, and the first indication of this is the opening. Electronica that would seemingly be completely out of tone feels a natural fit- and in the show itself, jazz and other surprising influences can be detected in the soundtrack. For the most part, the music is subdued and subordinate to the events unfolding (slowly) on screen, and makes for an excellent fit. There is nothing astounding here, and I would not call the soundtrack memorable, but it does serve the series well.  
 
 Character: 10 
 Characters are this anime's greatest strength, and the compelling force around which the show is built. Masa is a gloomy protagonist who never wallows in his misfortune, but quietly suffers with concerns about his own inadequacy and failure as a Samurai. Yaichi's motivations are inscrutable, as are those of the burglar Matsu. Some characters, such as Masa himself, Souji, or the tavernkeep and his daughter are immensely likable.  
  
 
 Enjoyment: 9  
 The show lacks fanservice or flashiness, but is extremely good to sit down to with a hot cup of tea for a quiet evening. It is thoughtful, and promotes feelings of calm and contemplation as each episode ends. In this respect it is similar to the Iyashikei moé slice-of-life series. Although Saraiya Goyou is filled with tense moments and conflict, it ultimately leaves the viewer more at peace than they started.  
 
 Overall: 
 There is a fine line between ""at peace"" and ""bored"", and Sairaya Goyou will never have a wide fanbase for this reason. I owe the show a debt for helping me through a difficult time, entirely thanks to its capacity for calming disquiet and engrossing the viewer in the lazy, dreamlike intrigues of an Edo-period tavern. Sairaya Goyou deserves praise for telling a story without pandering to audience expectation or action for its own sake. The art, music and events all feel designed to work to a specific purpose in the story's mood, and nothing is allowed to remain solely for its own merit or flashiness.  
 
 I would absolutely recommend this anime to anyone who likes Japanese  history, a good character-driven drama, or someone interested in a distinctively drawn and painstakingly-developed story.

    The streets glow with a crimson hue. 
 
Upon closer gaze, a pattern of five-pointed leaves stained with a fiery red flutter in synchronized elegance, encapsulating the essence of an enigmatic tale told in the 12-episode anime titled Saraiya Goyou or House of Five Leaves. Based on the manga by Natsume Ono, Saraiya Goyou tells a slow-burning narrative revolving around an unemployed samurai named Masa, who in simple desperation, finds himself hired by Yaichi – the leader of a small band of thieves who call themselves the Five Leaves.  
 
The bulk of the series focuses on the dynamics between the members of the Five Leaves, specifically Masa and Yaichi. Naturally then, this series is an entirely character-driven drama that entices with a very clear handle on its ambitions. Surprisingly enough, the fundamental strength of this series comes from its ability to deceive; from the characters to its progression. The series keeps itself under a veil, revealing in perfect doses, what’s necessary to tempt and assume, only to taunt those assumptions back into their flawed origins. It is in no way a standard samurai tale featuring spectacular sword fights or thrilling wars between conflicted states; rather it aims to do something far more basic than that and that is to tell an unassuming story about individuals trying to find their place in a fragmented society, where meaning is lost, and relationships are forged through coin and sin.  
 
The character’s journey to find sanctuary, belonging, and one’s self - when there seems to be very little hope - is a premise that echoes throughout time and land, and can be found really in every medium. What sets Saraiya Goyou apart in its story-telling is the mechanics it uses and the subtlety it does it with. All of the characters that are part of the “Five Leaves” find themselves together, bound by an unspoken contract and sense of camaraderie, but what’s important here is: why? The manner in which the series examines each individual’s motivation for doing so is nothing short of magnificent. Under the ruse of “criminal activities” whether its kidnappings, or thievery, or blackmail, the activities of “Five Leaves” are never the focal point, but rather it’s the interactions, reactions, and the impact of each respective crime on the band, and the individual characters themselves and that's what elevates the series. Thus, the show is able to streamline what it wants to do at all time, which is fleshing out the characters with every scene, and it does that, without skipping a beat.  
 
As the crimes escalate in risk, so do the vulnerabilities and traits of the characters regardless of how deceptive they may have seemed, initially, which brings up the strengths in the development of the individual characters. From the naïve, black-eyed Masa who suffers from a lack of confidence in his craft and himself; to the enigmatic white-haired, powder-blue eyed Yaichi with a seriously deceptive smile;  to the reserved, lone-wolf-type Matsu – the gang’s spy – who is as reckless as he is reserved; to Take, the sultry geisha with a sharp tongue and undying loyalty to the gang; to Umezou, the unofficial member with a stained past trying to clean up his present and future, yet offers the Five Leaves his tavern as their meeting place. All of these characters with their idiosyncrasies and quirks are a pleasure to witness as they try to fulfill their own goals while maintaining the House of Five Leaves. It is astounding the amount of meticulous effort that went into each gesture, interaction, and conversation when evaluated elementally, and how those come together to give dimension to each character, and the relationships that come as a product. 
 
The last defining point of the characters is their design. Saraiya Goyou is not only unique in its content, but also in technical achievement and aesthetical quality. The art-style of this series is very peculiar. Uneven lines, big circular eyes blobbed with a simple pattern and one color, mouths drawn in a way to make the Joker envious - the way the artistic design comes together is indeed very different, but for a series as out-standing, as it is, it complements it perfectly.  
 
Even the background art and the music that accompanied the story-telling were equally fitting such as the subdued use of color except for very intentional markers such as the crimson leaf, or Yaichi’s eyes, or objects that consistently enhanced the mood or scene, contextually or situationally. The serene shamisen accompanied by the jubilant accordion and flute seemed to be the instruments of choice and bode well, as they really heightened the time-period it was depicting. Overall, every element seems to have been crafted only to tell this story, and Saraiya Goyou is that series where everything just came together in just the right way. 
 
As slow-burning as this show is, it’s worth experiencing for all those who enjoy a well-seasoned, character-driven tale. It isn’t flashy. It isn’t in your face. Saraiya Goyou is more like an impressionistic painting, which requires patience to fully appreciate the details. The strengths lie deeper than a first-look like within its stylistic choices, its clandestine characters, its simplicity, and unparalleled elegance.  
 
Though, don’t be deceived; even though it may run at a relaxed pace and seem indifferent to action, the impassioned crimson-hearted House of Five Leaves and their members will surely persuade you to stay until the end…

    Peace and serenity, independence of the mind, graceful beauty, resting, & death; the rich magnificence of a maple leaf as it falls at the closing of its years. Before we begin, I would like to say that no other symbolism can effectively associate itself with Saraiya Goyou moreso than that of a satin maple leaf. 
 
At this very instance, the broad versatility of references that exists within this beautiful piece of nature constructs a focal point for everything that Saraiya Goyou is and stands for. To me, it simply opts to convey every aspect of the rich symbolic context of a maple leaf through its character driven drama, plot, and art. 
 
For story, I want to take note of the way that Saraiya Goyou handles its episodic nature by overlapping many of the stories into other episodes to effectively condense the series and maintain a level of fluid consistency between each episode and cleverly allowing minor points in these plots to serve a purpose later on in the series. Building on that, what I am more particularly fond of is the fast-paced ""snappy"" style of storytelling. For example, in many cases an episode will go into immense depth on tactics that will be used to carry out a crime that the characters are planning to execute and then suddenly, after this discussion of tactics and such, the actions that they were discussing have taken place and in the very next scene the characters will be dealing with the consequences or an issue that was encountered in the off-screen event. It's not a generally favourable story-telling style but it allows room for more development of the characters that is far more down to earth. 
 
This style also allows room for heavy interpretation of many events that take place off-screen and is essentially fast-paced, focused story development that never looses an ounce of its vigour. It's a case where the producers seemed to know exactly how long to make the show which is a problem that I have had many times with anime. 
 
Another thing that I wish to emphasize is how the show adapts its dialogue in such a way that it is constantly melded into each characters personality and essentially never falls into the pit of telling the story rather than showing it. Sure this kind of observation has been made on other series before, but in my mind Saraiya Goyou is one of the best examples of dialogue driven storytelling that show-cases an equilibrium between the audience and itself. 
 
Another dimension that I appreciated of Saraiya Goyou was the Robin Hood nature of the scenario's that it looked at, but unlike Robin Hood, all the scenario's were not left morally ambiguous but were ""heavily in the grey"" from the criminals perspective (e.g. the entire main cast) or the one's being subjugated to the criminal activity. In many respects it is quite suspicious that many of those at the receiving end of the criminals activities were more or less deserving but the best thing about it, is that it doesn't make a clear cut judgement on the themes that it explores, which are (at their core) very mature and sensitive topics and Saraiya Goyou takes a stance for a tasteful perspective on the mature themes that it explores which earns it extra credit in my book. 
 
 I rarely hand out a perfect score for anything, but this is one part of Saraiya Goyou that I really cannot find a flaw, simply put, its characters are nothing short of remarkable. Saraiya Goyou is essentially a character driven drama and the series comes across as completely aware of that. It is rare to find an anime where the characters are so well developed with such little time, so the character development I can allegedly say is masterful, no member of the cast is left out of the equation (yes including minor characters that are only on-screen for an episode or 2) each character has a fully orchestrated history that is highly detailed. Taking it a step further, to truly emphasize the beauty of the characters within this series is that the show has not one occasion where any character does anything ""out of character"" and when questionable actions take place, the context of the series steps in to justify those actions fair and square. 
 
The art in Saraiya Goyou whilst it is an acquired taste, is nothing short of beautiful in its detail with lavish background settings, the character designs are very interesting and hardly comparable to anything with a possible exception of Kaiji and Fantastic Children's noses (those noses, I can't get them out of my head), that said the ending product in the animation department is fascinating in that whilst it does not allow itself to revel in an exercise of romanticism of the Edo period what it does do is somehow allows an attachment to be built that tugs at my ""heart-strings"" inviting me into a world of rich depth, making me wish that I was a part of the whole ordeal unfolding between the characters. That said, I cannot quite put my finger on what it is about the art that makes me feel that way, is it perhaps a combination of its art and the simple exchanging of words as one hikes down the main road or even partaking these everyday activities through the streets of an Edo suburbia? 
 
I haven't got much to say on the sound department except for the fact that it gets the job done. The OST is oozing with tracks that set the mood and allow me to become engaged and invest in the emotional aspects of the series. Like the rest of the series, the music used remains sincerely reflective of a story that is constantly providing subtle questions from the grey area, and the music recognizes this, with that taken into consideration it kind of pains me to say that the score is the series weakest point. 
 
One thing that is possibly wrong with the series; is that it lacks entertainment value. Now I for one enjoyed the series immensely but as I mentioned before in my comment that the art in this show is an acquired taste, this statement also applies to the entire series. That said, to fully appreciate the series you may need to be a more experienced anime or manga fan, so it is not favourable for many that Saraiya Goyou excels in every other department except for high-octane stimulation but with all of this said the fact that Saraiya Goyou takes up this bold sense of direction remains a benefit to the show. It serves as a reminder that simple stimulation can only achieve so much and sometimes we need to step back and take our time to divulge in a shows inner essence, which is something that Saraiya Goyou does very very well. 
 
 There really isn't much else in the way of negatives and to be honest I am scratching my head trying to find a major flaw (there are 1 or 2 unbelievably-obscurely minor flaws that the only way that they would become major problems is if you kicked out logic in the first place). That said, there was one major flaw but quite contrarily the series managed to effectively rectify it in the end which makes it even more easier for me to say that this series is deserving of every bit of praise that it gets. 
 
Saraiya Goyou is a great anime, almost no flaws, amazingly well developed characters and top-notch execution all around. 
 I believe that a review should let you decide whether or not you should watch a show, and if I was the ronin in this series, I would invite you all to spend a quiet moment with Saraiya Goyou.

    Saraiya Goyou, or House of Five Leaves, is the latest work by cult studio Manglobe. Now, while it isn't generally a good idea for a critic to speak personally, it bears mention that this is the first time I have ever seen anything by Manglobe, so I can't really comment on how it compares to their previous works. However, the fact that Manglobe already have a cult following in spite of only having four previous works to their name (Samurai Champloo, Ergo Proxy, Michiko to Hatchin and Seiken no Blacksmith) says quite a lot about this studio. Now, I don't know if Saraiya Goyou is in the vein of their other works, but this is likely considering that Manglobe are known for having a completely unique style and presentation, both in story and visuals, and Saraiya Goyou not only delivers on this, but it does so in spades. 
 
The show revolves around a swordsman for hire. Right now, you may well be thinking of some underrated master swordsman, a badass with amazing skill, who slays men in their thousands. This could not be further from the truth. Whilst the swordsman, our main character Akitsu Masanosuke (usually called ""Masa"" for short) is a competent swordsman, he is completely human. There is nothing truly special about him. He is, however, rarely hired, in part because he looks so harmless. But this all begins to change when he meets a strange man calling himself Yaichi, who actually agrees to hire him. However, as Masa soon discovers, he's been hired to work for a group of kidnappers. He initially tries to leave, but soon finds himself more and more immersed in the criminals' world. 
 
Now, it's worth noting that this show has a very unusual art style. This can be extremely offputting to some people, which, alongside with the slow pace of this show, probably account for the incredibly low ratings this show had upon airing. This is a great shame, because as of writing this is probably the best anime of 2010. It starts off quite slow, making it hard to rope viewers in, but it slowly but surely hooks the viewer. The pace is often considered to be the best and worst thing about this anime. It seems boring, but at the same time, utterly captivating. It's strange, but no matter how slow the show is, you never want to stop watching. At the same time, the slow pace can make the important moments all the more impressive and memorable. 
 
When it comes to the cast, most of them are good characters, and there are no bad characters in this show. However, the ones everyone remembers are the leading pair, Masa and Yaichi. Lesser characters like Ume and Matsu are memorable, but they aren't nearly as impressive. While Masa starts out as awkward, spineless, and mildly annoying, over the course of the series he gradually comes out of his shell. He comes to impact the plot strongly, form bonds with the Five Leaves, and prove his worth repeatedly in a fantastic display of character development. While he isn't as impressive as Rock from Black Lagoon, another character who started out in a similar fashion, he's certainly a character worthy of praise. Yaichi, on the other hand, is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. He is the mysterious leader of the Five Leaves, and a highly interesting character. To speak of his past is to ruin the entire plot of the show. 
 
Now, while the art style is offputting for some, it is by no means bad. It doesn't take long to get used to, and the art is produced to a high standard, as is the animation. Both are joined with an interesting style that focuses on a subtle, yet rich darkness. A large amount of the series is set at night, viewed only by candlelight, if even that. The daytime scenes are often indoors, under shadow. And the high-quality production extends to the soundtrack as well. The background music is distinct and memorable, giving a unique feel to the show. The opening theme, ""Sign of Love"", is a great song that grows on you more with each passing episode. The only problem I have with the soundtrack is the ending theme, a fun, bouncy song that invariably seems completely out of place at the end of each episode. 
 
While Saraiya Goyou is by no means a show for everyone, it is a great watch for those who can appreciate it. Some patience will be necessary for viewing it, but it will not go unrewarded. 
 
Final Words: Watching every other Manglobe show just shot up significantly in my priorities.

    Every now and then a show is needed to unwind to. Something to break the monotony of the typical over-the-top anime shows with ""in your face"" color pallete and the overused tropes. We seek these melancholic shows to provide temporary release from the norm, a sort of meditative experience if you will. House of Five Leaves is that kind of show. A show that understands its audiences' desires and executes it with a delicate balance. This certainly isn't for anyone seeking an adrenaline rush or intense action flick but rather serves as an oasis for anime fans that want to just kick back and relax.  
 
 
Story: 7/10 
 
The story follows our protagonist Masanosuke as he searches for a purpose in which he can excel at. However being a wondering ronin limits his options to bodyguard duty and through this he becomes acquainted with the ""Five Leaves"": A band of kidnappers that target affluent people of questionable business behaviors to receive ransom. It isn't structured as a clear cut point A to point B narrative but more of a character driven one.  The show follows several mini arcs, each either involving the mission of the team or showing the main overarching story, which involves slowly unveiling the gangs' boss Yaichi's life and backstory. This slowly exfoliates  throughout the show's duration with a ending that wraps everything up nicely by coming full circle. The effectiveness of the story is within its simplicity. Since its structured in such a simple way it allows the characters in it to breath life into their world as they remain the primary focus throughout. It's simple storytelling done right.  
 
Art/animation: 8/10 
 
 Everything from the opaque backgrounds to the character's visual aesthetic was handled with great care. It's like a painting brought to life. The world building was also handled well, as you're immediately sucked into the setting and time period that the story takes place in. You can also tell that the animators had a grasp of capturing a sense of depth of frame, as there was a clear distinction separating the foreground from the background, something many shows tend to neglect to do. They use an acid washed color palette accompanied with rich blacks and other textures to help build an aura that looms over the entire show, bathing in a distinct tinge of melancholy while still being easygoing. They were also aware of when and how to use color, as they would limit color choices given the kind of mood they're trying to capture and convey. This was evident with flashbacks and key episodes throughout the show. It's an impressive display of color theory and color placement that was spearheaded by a talented and impassioned crew of creators.   
The character designs of Five Leaves are far from conventional. They all share a distinct facial structure with gaping looking eyes (as shown on the anime art cover), which, despite the obtuse expression, was actually pulled off well. They become a part of the environment they're presented in and are uniquely designed when compared to the ""run of the mill"" brightly colored haired bishounens we're used to seeing. This unique character design gave the show its trademark identity that made it stand out from the crowd. Whether you like it or not comes down to preference but there's no denying its distinct look. 
 
Sound: 6.5/10 
 
It's hard pinpointing the soundtrack for the show. Sure It had its somber piano ballads, traditional Japanese song instrumentals and other pieces to accompany its usual easy going setting, but there are some tracks that are clearly inspired by French/European flavoring with an Accordion playing throughout certain songs. Seeing that this anime is set during an Edo period Japan, the cultural clash of European influenced music seems like a rather odd choice. One would think they would stick to only traditional instruments of that era of Japan's history, such as the more common placed Biwa or Koto stringed instruments for example. This does not take away from the music used but it would have certainly set a better tone if the show would have taken a stricter cultured route. If they were going for a self-aware cultural mash-up like Samurai Champloo it would have been understandable but they clearly wasn't. It's certainly a unique choice but sometimes it doesn't fit the mood as well. Seeing that music is subjective to one's tastes, how much this bother you as a viewer will vary. Hell, it may not even register with you at all, which in any case it doesn't do much to hinder the show's overall quality to begin with. You can see this as more of a personal nitpick than an actual problem. 
The voice actors were also well composed. Everyone came across like they were in their element, this made the character interactions to show great chemistry. Almost like listening to a conversation between old friends, which in turn allowed for great immersion.  
 
Characters: 8/10 
 
   Our main protagonist Masa suffers from a clear case of inferiority complex. Although this approach isn't new it's handled well and not made out to be simple melodrama. It's nice to see him strive for self-worth without sacrificing his ideals as a person, with him being a man with a decent moral compass. Another refreshing aspect is that he doesn't throw this ideal around like a bishonen MC would, but rather expresses it to show his distaste for certain actions. Due to his timid behavior, however, he doesn't seem to fight against the actions his companions take. This may make him out to be a push over but due to the character interactions it's never abused for unnecessary drama. Slowly but surely he opens up to the lifestyle of the group and proves his worth. 
   Yaichi is by far the most enigmatic and captivating character, mostly due to his ambiguous and collective personality. He always steals the spotlight in whichever scene he's in, as we as viewers are constantly trying to piece together his true motives. He isn't simply clear cut as ""the cool guy"" but more so a person that seem to dabble in the grey, which makes his presence unnerving at times.  
   Ume is a man of stubborn pride that only seem to care for those who he's close to. He takes on the role of big brother to the others and is often the one with the sharp tongue. He isn't afraid to speak his mind but is also protective of his friends and family. Just like Masa he has a moral compass, but unlike him, he isn't afraid to get his hands dirty if it means protecting the ones closest to him. 
   Matsu seem to be a closed off individual that is all about business and fulfilling his obligations. He's the information gatherer of the group and his job reflects his personality. He can be summed up as a lone wolf. He only show respect to those he's indebted to and shows loyalty to the group but never brings up anything regarding his personal life. Due to his detachment to others he isn't quite explored until later into the show with his individual arc.  
   Otake is a rather carefree woman, she doesn't seem to take anything too seriously but still composes herself to a degree. She seems to go about things on a whim with a smile always on her face and always find pleasure in the company of others. Her past, like the others in the group, is revealed later on, which brought another aspect to the story involving Yaichi. There isn't much to her in layered characterization but she is still a nice addition to the group.  
 
the rest of the supporting cast also play their roles well and don't need over the top quirky personalities to be understood. They simply play their roles in the story without overstepping their boundaries.  
Together these characters are all subtle in execution and are down to earth enough that their presence feel natural. The air of maturity complimented the melancholic tone of the show quite well. This brings forth nice organic character interactions between them, making all their time on screen a pleasure to watch. All the characters show a sense of honor as to be expected among Japanese customs. This mutual comradery for each other is what makes this cast among the better ones anime has to offer. 
 
Enjoyment: 8.5/10 
 
I entered this anime to seek escape from the usual dime a dozen shows and that's exactly what I got. It's soothing, got to the point and didn't overstay its welcome. For that, I can easily recommend this to anyone seeking the same kind of escape as myself. 
 
Overall: 7.5/10 
 
Don't be fooled, this anime will not be everyone's cup of tea. It's not trying to impress the audience nor is it trying to be more than it is. It's simply an anime that slowly unfolds a simple story on its own pace. If you're looking for a show to relax to or just something to offer a break from anime's usual tropes then this might be just the remedy. But if you're looking for intense samurai action flick and a grandiose story I advise you look somewhere else.  
 
As for other recommendations, I point you towards: 
 
Mushishi: A show that also captures the familiar melancholic atmosphere, accompanied with unique character designs and tranquil presentation. It also takes its time exploring its world and individual stories. However, it lacks an overarching story as oppose to House of Five Leaves.  
 
Shigurui: You won't find the tranquil easy going nature of House of Five Leaves here but what they do share in common is that sense of mutual comradery, slow pacing and similar Edo period world setting with samurais. Also, it has a slowly unfolding backstory of certain characters as well. Be warned though, it's a VERY bloody show and follows more of a grittier approach. If you're one who doesn't want to see a bloodbath, stay away.

    Saraiya Goyou is about a gang called “Five Leaves” during the Edo period in Japan.  There is very little action, the artwork is nontraditional, and the story moves at a snail’s pace.  So why should anyone pay attention to this?  Actually, I’d say that those points work to Saraiya Goyou’s advantage, resulting in a well-written, mature story.  
 
 
Story & Characters 
 
The members of Five Leaves make their money through undercover jobs such as kidnapping, but they are not the usual rough and tough gangsters. Most of them appear to be friendly, thoughtful people who spend their time lounging around in a relaxed environment, discussing personal issues until their next job. The gang includes a charismatic leader, a shy swordsman, a shop owner, a metallic ornament craftsman, and a woman.  Their varied personalities make them an unlikely group to hang out, but they manage to work together on behalf of Five Leaves. 
 
This series is completely character-driven and wastes no time in exploring the member’s personal backgrounds, revealing each of their motives for joining the gang in the first place.  Perhaps the most intriguing member of Five Leaves is the leader himself, Yaichi. He is admired for his calm demeanor, yet he is perceived as mysterious because he seems to hide a lot of information about himself.  The show delves into how the other members feel about Yaichi, particularly the shy swordsman who is new to the group. 
 
The scenes move slowly and quietly as you watch the characters contemplate about things, plan their missions, and embark on a few short travels.  You won’t see a lot of sword fighting or other eventful action here.  Even when the members carry out a job, it is more about information gathering and sneaking around places rather than fighting.  That is not to say that the show never has its intense moments though; it masterfully weaves in tension and drama just at the right times. 
 
The characters are so down-to-earth and believable that the pleasure of this series comes from observing their close interactions, facial expressions, dialogue, and the subtle changes in their personalities.  If you don’t particularly enjoy concentrating on such details, this series might be perceived as a bit dull. 
   
 
Artwork & Animation 
 
I know a few people who thought that Saraiya Goyou was quite interesting, but they couldn’t continue watching it because they were distracted by the character designs. They're distinguished by having dark, gloomy eyes, pointy noses, and low, wide mouths. Some people just say ""frog faces.""  Even though they are a little odd, I find the designs to be personally fitting in the context of this series.  I've also known them to grow on viewers who have given them a chance. 
 
The amount of detail in the animation is very impressive.  For example, I appreciate how well they animated the momentum of water in a cup while it was being swayed or tilted, the breeze effect on a lighted candle after a door was just closed, and the fluid movement of the characters.  The artwork is finely detailed as well and really captures the look and feel of the Edo period. 
 
 
Atmosphere 
 
There always seems to be a dark cloud looming over the characters.  Their minds are heavy with thoughts of their pasts and current responsibilities.  Some viewers say that the show is merely all about ""gloomy people,"" and they are right to a certain degree.  The characters aren't that upbeat, but despite that, the atmosphere doesn't feel depressing all of the time.  I found that there's also a lighter air of relaxation and occasional amusement which adds to the enjoyment of watching. 
 
 
Sound 
 
The opening song, “Sign of Love” by Immi, is a melodic, electronic beat which surprised me.  I took a liking to it, so I had high hopes for the rest of the soundtrack.  Fortunately, the background music has been superb.  Nearly every musical piece is a calm, soothing melody that enhances the show’s atmosphere.  Some of the tunes are also catchy, and I’ve found myself randomly playing them in my head. 
 
 
Overall 
 
Without a doubt, Saraiya Goyou is a must-see from the Spring 2010 season.  Rather than relying on action to tell its story, the show excels in rich characterization, detailed animation, sound, subtleness, and realism.  Saraiya Goyou is an example of maturity in anime at its best.

    What if there was an anime, an anime that was about samurai. This anime wasn't about ""the strongest samurai"" or ""the path to glory"" or even a ""demon sword,"" but instead it was about meek looking samurai with slightly above average skills. He wasn't looking to fight the strongest fight, or defeat the overlord and free his people, but maybe, he was just looking to make his living and help his little sister back at home. That would be, if not anything, interesting. That's exactly what Sarai-ya Goyou (House of the Five Leaves) is about. This anime isn't for those who live to see explosions and special effects and isn't even for people who want to see some fight scenes - there's only about two or three in the entire series, and for an anime that has its main protagonist as a bodyguard, that's pretty strange. 
 
Story: 8/10 
Welcome to the Five Leaves, an association of almost chivalrous robbers (I say almost because, well, they keep what they ""earn"" but do their jobs for the greater good). The story follows our already stated protagonist, Masa, the not-so-scary swordsman. Masa is in need of a job, since he keeps getting fired, because well, he just isn't good at being a bodyguard. It doesn't suit him. This is when he runs into the Five Leaves. The leader of the Five Leaves, Yaichi, is a bouncer at the local brothel. After a chain of events Masa joins up with Yaichi to take on jobs such as smuggling, theft, kidnapping, and so on. Also in the group are many other interesting characters - Ume the tavern owner, Okinu his daughter, Otake a local prostitute, and Matsu an unfriendly swordsman. The stories behind each of these characters are all eventually divulged, thus I don't want to ruin any of the fun here. All I can say about the story is that while at the beginning of the series it looks pretty weak, and by the end, it comes and hits you in the face pretty dang strong. 
 
Art: 9/10 
Er well... If you don't like the art then well, there's no hope. You won't like this anime. The art I believe, is incredibly important to setting the mood of the anime. Awkward. No not like ""that's so awkward"" but like... It brings you out of your comfort zone of what you usually see in anime, while not being CrAzY like Trapeze or Yojou-han. The Animation is fine, but there really isn't a whole lot if it. The anime heavily relies on dialogue to explain things, unlike other samurai anime like Sword of the Stranger that heavily relies on animation to tell it's tale. If you liked the artist behind Ristorante Paradiso, you're in luck because well, it's the exact same one - Ono Natsume!  
 
Sound: 10/10 
Simply brilliant. Each track of this anime got me snapping or tapping my finger, even if just a little bit. Every song sounded original and interesting and just... fun! The sound is like elevator music, infused with light techno, and a little jazz. It doesn't distract you from the anime, but you simply can't ignore it. The opening song, ""Sign of Love"" by immi is also just awesome - a light technopop opening in MY anime about samurais? Magnificent. The ending was nice too, but barely compares to the soundtrack and opening. The voice acting was great too. Namikawa Daisuke (Hohenheim from FMA:B) and Takahiro Sakurai (Suzaku from Code Geass) voice the two protagonists, Masa and Yaichi. If you like either you now have a very good reason to sitting your arse down and watching this anime. But fear not! The rest of the casts voices are also just so... right! So spot on! Takahiro Ai (who I've never heard of before until this anime) voiced Okinu, the young girl who assists at the tavern where the Five Leaves meets has such a cute voice it's deadly! I hope to hear more of her in the future. Overall, the sound is a feast for the ears and skipping out on it is like saying you don't like your ears. Your ears would be very sad if they heard that. 
 
Character: 9/10 
I've actually addressed most of the characters at this point. Yaichi, the ""lone mysterious cool guy"" actually gets some of the most character development I've ever seen and part of the second half of the anime hinges on him alone. To be blunt, he isn't as cool and suave as he is first introduced to be. Masa obviously is a deeper character than first presented and I noticed a lot of people complaining how much of a ""wimp"" and ""loser"" he is. Let me say this, if all the protagonists in anime were AWESOME and COOL then anime itself as a medium would suck. Masa actually doesn't even whine or complain at ALL throughout the series, and saying he's a wimp is like calling Shinji from NGE cool. It's just not gonna fly. He undergoes some serious character development and by the end of the series he well, can be seen in a different light than before. Matsu is another character I'd like to talk about. He at first appears to be another cold and unfriendly character, but by goodness this anime manages to make even him look good. The secondary characters are all strong and interesting in themselves but a few here and there are kind of shallow (not many, but some). Whilst not perfect, House of Five Leaves has some of the most realistic characters I've seen to date that are simply just - human. 
 
Enjoyment: 8/10: 
Even with all these awesome aspects, the show can at times be a mixed-bag. Flashbacks at confusing times, with confusing material addressed, in a confusing way, and backgrounds that usually don't have much color or vibrancy in them (but seeing as a lot of the anime takes place at night I can accept that). The weird pacing that takes place early in the series, while very different, can be a major turn-off. The latter half of the series is totally amazing and ties off and puts a nice bow on top of everything occurring at the start of the series. It's not hard to miss something in this anime too, which was kind of a problem, because if you space out for a little while, you can miss some serious plot. If you don't like heavy dialogues and minimal action, then I don't recommend you try this anime, but if you could see yourself giving it a try, then heck, go for it. 
 
Overall: 8/10 
There's nothing disappointing about this anime while I believe there could have been improvement. It's an intelligent anime that is better watched alone, and focus is definitely necessary, but a rewarding anime it is. You'll be glad you checked out House of Five Leaves. 
 
This anime will never be popular. You will never see someone wearing a Sarai-ya Goyou T-Shirt. You will never see someone pretend to be Masa and do his samurai techniques. It's not that kind of anime. It's an anime that is doomed to be unpopular and only spoken of on the smallest portions of internet forums and be referenced as ""a hidden gem."" I don't know why all gems have to be hidden, but the statement stands true with Sarai-ya Goyou. It's an anime that can easily be overlooked if you didn't take the time to check it out, so go take 12 episodes of your time (and a fast 12 it is) and enjoy yourself with House of Five Leaves.

    masterpiece. 
""We're always together. We said that we'd always be."" - Nagisa Furukawa. 
Is Clannad another""crying game""? If you want a long answer... Unlike Kanon, Clannad has a lighter touch to it. It does not focus too much on boy-girl love(although in some character's route it does), but more on thefamily love and the sweetness of friendship. 
Also Clannad has a very clean cut in touching moments. They make you cry slightly, but not like Air and Kanon where you'd cry to exhaustion. Also the humors in Clannad is pretty good. I have a count of spitting tea on my monitor for at least four times due to laughter. 
Touching moments does not necessary occur between the main character and the girls. You(the main character) actually got the most touching non-boy-girl moments. Listen to the BGM'to the same heights'to get a better idea of it.

    This anime is absolutely amazing. It made me laugh, it made me cry, I couldn't stop watching it! I had to take my mind off it by watching other animes so it didn't pass so quickly, I wanted the experience to last forever. I am a big fan of romance, so I personally prefer this anime to nearly any other anime I have ever watched. The character development is just outstanding. The plot confused me slightly at one point, and there were quite a few points that they left open and haven't finished. I'm not sure if they are making another Clannad sequel, but if they're not, it would be a massive shame to not have those loose ends tied. Overall, I think this is a must see anime. It is breathtakingly good. You MUST watch this!

    *Before I start my review, I would like to say that I strongly encourage you to watch Clannad first. If you are wondering if you should watch Clannad for the pure reason of watching After Story, I would not encourage you to do so. Clannad is not something that should be treated as a stumbling block. Also, After Story will be much less enjoyable if you haven't seen Clannad, or if you didn't enjoy Clannad. 
 
What does it mean to watch a truly great anime? When I finished After Story, I was watching it on my laptop in the student center of my college. The show ended, and I found myself in a state of euphoria. I looked around and saw all of these people, going about their day, all completely oblivious to what I had experienced. This left me with something that many call ""the void."" 
 
The void is a feeling of emptiness. You feel like you have lost something, and you want to find something else to make you feel whole again. You can get this feeling from anything of course, whether it's music, a movie, a book, or maybe a real life experience. And what makes the void so bad is that you may fear that you will never experience something so great ever again. Clannad: After Story probably gave me a bigger void than any kind of media ever had.  
 
Something I hate to hear is when people say, ""After Story is better than Clannad."" Is it? Well...yeah, but it is not so simple as just being better than its predecessor. You see, they are both the same story. After Story doesn't just become written better or introduce different characters. The characters in Clannad are for the most part the same ones in After Story. So if that's the case, why is After Story better? 
 
When you watch a romantic anime, there is a tendency for it to end with questions left unanswered. Sometimes, the love interests just kiss. Sometimes, they just tell each other that they love each other. Heck, I've seen a show where the characters just look at each other and then realize in their heads that they like each other. However, After Story gives the viewer answers to what happens after our love interests finally get to first base. 
 
*Minor spoilers for Clannad ahead, just in case you haven't seen it yet. 
 
At the end of Clannad, Tomoya and Nagisa finally tell each other their feelings, but they don't kiss or anything. If you watch the OVA's, you know that it took weeks for them just to hold hands. But their lives move beyond that, and After Story shows us how.  
 
After Story takes place directly where Clannad stopped. The first nine episodes are very similar to the arcs in Clannad, so at first, you don't even notice the show change. Then, the characters’ graduate and move on with their lives. Simply put, they become adults. Crazy for a romantic anime to take place somewhere outside high school. Telling you more than that would start spoiling things. But letting the story move beyond the standard setting of school allows for more creative writing and character development. That's not to say the writing of Clannad was bad though. But when you experience the trials of the characters, you will understand what I mean.  
 
In my review for Clannad, I mentioned that a big problem with it is that it has a hard time breaking away from its visual novel roots. With After Story, you wouldn't have known it was a visual novel in the first place. My second problem with Clannad is that all of the arcs involving supporting characters inhibited the show from letting the main story and main characters’ shine. In After Story, there only is one story...kind of. 
 
After Story also continues the side story about the girl and the garbage doll. I can't say what it is about, why it is there, or when it will make sense. If I said anything, it would spoil something. I do have a suggestion: pay attention to the side story, as well as the main story. I can't say what exactly to look for, but pay attention. It may prove fruitful later. 
 
I have to give you one warning: After Story is a slice of life anime, but it does have a tiny little bit of magic or whatever in it. Some may be disappointed by this. Still, not of a big deal.  
 
As far as technicalities go, not much has changed. We are given the same 3D graphics seen in the Illusionary World, the same pretty flower petals floating in the wind, and the same soundtrack. Is that bad? No, absolutely not. I will however say that we are given a couple more tracks along with the old ones, if that makes any difference to you.    
 
Out of any anime of this genre, After Story is the best of the best. There is nothing so unique, well written, or emotional. And oh boy, THIS SHOW IS EMOTIONAL. You see, most shows only hit you once or twice with the proverbial baseball bat, but Clannad: After Story does not know when to stop. 
 
Clannad: After Story is a true masterpiece, and I think that any fan of anime should experience it.

    Clannad: After Story how many say this anime influenced and changed their lives I decided to review this anime and point out both the good and bad aspects of the anime. 
 
 
Art: 8/10   The art is very good nothing bad about it. I've seen better but also has the Key style art theme so I like it. 
 
Sound: 8/10 Great Voice Actors/Actresses and the soundtrack was great but a bit repetitive. 
 
Now for the real part of the review. 
Story: 2/10 
The story is about Tomoya who is acting like a spoiled brat who cries every few minutes about his dad. Tomoya develops slightly as the show progresses but very slowly. He even has to take out his anger on a child.  The development of the story was just horrible. I really don't understand how people consider this a such a beautiful story. 
 
The Characters: 6/10 
 
As a fan of the visual novel they pretty much adapted all of the characters correctly in terms of personality with the exception of one but i'll get to that in a bit. The characters are all fairly likable and easily able to be attached to if the show actually had character development. 
 
Tomoya: Horrible protagonist in the anime. He cries about his father trying to take good care of him and doesn't understand anything about being an adult. He takes his problems out on others. He is a good friend to the few he has is his only positive trait.  
 
Nagisa: Nothing bad about her except her taste in men. She is nearly a perfect heroine you are really able to get attached to her as the story progresses. 
 
Ushio: The character that I feel sorry for the most. Unlike Tomoya she isn't a crybaby who has a legit reason to cry yet she shows more maturity than Tomoya ever has. 
 
 
The Enjoyment: 0.75/10  
 
I enjoyed 1 episode of After Story, Ushio, Nagisa, and that is pretty much it. 
 
I am grateful for seeing this anime because it introduced me to the visual novel of Clannad which I gave a 9.5/10  but I really don't know why people enjoy this anime. 
 
Overall 4/10 I recommend this anime as a comedy on how they tried to make a serious anime but failed horribly and turned it into a mockery.

    Definitely the most touching thing I have ever experienced. If someone told me I would cry watching an anime a year ago I would have told them they were crazy. Since I started watching anime I have only seen a select few which made me experience such emotion. 
 
Spice and Wolf almost made me cry one tear. 
 
Air almost made me cry one tear. 
 
FMA Brotherhood made me cry one manly tear. 
 
Kanon (2006) made me cry one manly tear. 
 
Guilty Crown made me shed one manly tear. 
 
Code Geass made me cry one or two manly tears. 
 
I guess at this point the tears stop being manly. 
 
Clannad: Afterstory made me cry at least SIX tears, four of which came simultaneously. 
 
If that doesn't say enough about Clannad Afterstory, then here's the actual review: 
 
WARNING: SPOILER FOR FIRST SEASON OF CLANNAD 
 
Story 10/10  
 
The story follows the life of Tomoya after he graduates and is in a relationship with Nagisa. I am not sure how to describe much more of the story without giving spoilers because we already know who the characters are from watching the first part. 
 
Art 9/10 
 
Sound 10/10  
 
Sound done by Jun Maeda/KEY Sounds Label, very well done... The opening song is incredible and very emotional. The Dango Family song... just watch the show and yeah. The ending song: I actually think the ending song is quite good... HOWEVER BE WARNED: it is extremely upbeat and when it plays after a certain episode you may be tempted to punch the computer/TV screen or shut off the volume immediately.  
 
Characters 10/10 
 
The characters are all so loveable. You will always be rooting for them, part of the reason why this anime is so heartbreaking. 
 
Enjoyment 10/10 
 
Easily one of the greatest anime of all time, definitely deserves the MAL score of over 9. 
 
Overall 10/10 
 
One of my all time favorites. Just don't let anyone tell you to skip Clannad and go straight for Afterstory.

    It's amazing how an anime can change the way you think. After Story is a truly amazing and touching anime. It is one of a kind, a true masterpiece in my opinion. I didn't have too high expectations of After Story after watching Clannad. But don't misunderstand me, Clannad is a great anime, but it also lacked a lot. After Story though, is flawless.  
 
Story (10/10): After Story begins where Clannad left and revolves mainly around Tomoya and Nagisa's relationship, even though the other characters sometimes pop up. We get to dive in into their lives and focus on their growth, love, grief and happiness. The days, months and years pass by. They go from students to adults and realize how wonderful life can be. But at the same time, life can be very cruel. 
 
The pacing is perfect. It's not too slow, but it calmly tells the story and leisurely moves from one arc to another.  
 
Characters (10/10): After watching Clannad you already know the characters. In After Story you get the chance to know them better and grow with them as the story goes. Their backgrounds are revealed, mysteries gets their answers and little by little you feel as if you're there with them. You laugh and cry alongside with them.  
 
THAT, people, is what a slice of life story should be like!  
It's almost scary, that's how realistic the characters seem to be.  
 
Sound (9/10): I have absolutely nothing to complain about here. They have picked great pieces for the somewhat sad story. ""Dango Daikazoku"" has a memorable melody and is played several times trough the series. I don't think there's anyone who've seen Clannad and isn't moved to tears every time that piece is played. It eches onto your heart.  
 
Art (9/10): The art is mindblowing.  
The cherry trees, the great fields filled with sunflowers and the cute firefly-filled nights. Everything is so beautifully drawn down to the smallest details. The mood is created beautifully through both art and sound.  
 
Enjoyment (10/10): After Story swipes you off your feet and grabs your heart. I strongly recommend everyone to watch Clannad and After Story. This is an amazing anime and should be a must for anyone to watch.  
And remember; never, EVER, take ANYONE you love for granted. You never know when they're gone.  
 
Overall (10/10): What do you learn from this story? 
 
You learn not to take anyone for granted. You learn to cherish your loved ones. You learn about the difficulties of life and the importance of being thankful for what you have. Life isn't always about living happily ever after. There is so much more to it. Even if your fairy tale didn't go as planned, never give up. Look at what you have. Life holds many surprises.

    Clannad ~AS~ is one of those few of animes that I can really put into my list of Likes. Anybody who drops this show I can first-handedly call you a idiot. I know, maybe you guys read about the summary saying that Okazaki and Nagisa are together and are looking forward to it.You all watch the first few episodes and nothing happened, but when it starts happening, the show can get only more and more awesome than what it is. 
 
Clannad ~AS~ is a anime that talks about the truth of the world, how most people lived (mainly focuses on teens, in this anime). It talks about the joy, sorrow and every dang feelings we will experience when this is happening.

    Ahhh Clannad After Story, there's very little praise I could give to this that hasn't been said before. It's funny when it wants to be funny, depressing when it wants to be depressing, and flat out amazing when it wants to be amazing. It starts out a bit slow but when it gets into gear it REALLY gets into gear.  
 
In After Story, most of the characters from Clannad really start getting the shaft, with Nagisa's parents really being the only ones other than the main couple that stay a consistent presence throughout the series. I'll say that Clannad has one of my absolute favorite cast of characters in pretty much any anime I've ever seen, so seeing a lot less of them in this series is in a way, sort of disappointing. But it's also realistic, and really makes the impact of moving on all the more effective.  
 
After Story at its core is basically just about two young people being forced to accept change and trying to become adults in their society. It brings up a lot of powerful points, and is one of those animes that really gets you thinking about your own life. This is one of the many reasons this show is so powerful for people. 
 
NOTE: THIS PARAGRAPH MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS 
 
But... if there is one thing I'll say about this show, quite frankly, the ending kind of sucked. It's hard to say what I disliked about it without saying any spoilers but seriously. It was handled really well, and in some ways it was downright beautiful. But when you take a moment to think about what actually HAPPENED in the ending... umm... yeah, just bullshit. The paranormal aspect of this show is pretty much my absolute least favorite part. It just makes things more confusing and takes away from the realism that made some of the scenes so emotionally affecting. And then they somehow make THAT happen... just... what. Everybody loves a happy ending, but in this case it's an ending that pretty much just gives a middle finger to all of the events that lead up to it. It is one of the absolute worst ways to end it I could even think of, because it sours up some of the amazing scenes and made me question why the F those even happened in the first place. 
 
END SPOILERS 
 
The slow start and the ending stop me from being able to justify giving this show a 10. But that doesn't mean it's a bad show, it's still amazing. Beautiful from start to finish even. If you haven't watched it yet, do it. Even if you didn't like the first season all that much. And if you haven't watched the original Clannad... well watch that first :P

    Clannad was very, very good, but Clannad ~ After Story was the apex. Until this season, I was proud of myself by not feeling absolutely anything in any movie, series or animes. Clannad ~After Story came to change that. The story isn't the most creative around, but it's the way it's told that really touches you. Seriously, if you watch this entire series and still doesn't feel anything inside, then you are a true cold-hearthed monster. 
 
I seriously recommend the entire Clannad series not just to anime fans, but to everyone interested in movies, theater or any other medium. It's extremely satisfactory and may even make you drop some tears.

    As it may seem i am writing this review long after i finished After Story. The first season, Clannad, gave off some good character development and background to some other minor things that set up for the continuation of the story at hand. 
 
Story: 9/10 
The plot or story of Clannad: After Story was fairy just a continuation of the first season. Key did a good job transitioning from the school life of the characters and into the adults they become at the end of the series. Overall it made a good impression on the watcher and made me feel like i was there. The emotion string were pulled and thats always a big plus. 
 
Art and Music: 8.5/10 
The art and animation of After Story was fairy good. The music was also up to par with the the art. The Dango Daikazuko was the song that will really pull your strings as it plays. There were some spots where the animation felt unnecessary or they could have added something different or changed a few things with character expressions. 
 
Characters 9.1/10 
The characters were just about the same this time around. The development into adult for the characters added more depth and feel to them. Okazaki learning how to be responsible was a big step in his development from being a lazy person hating school. Nagisa made improvements and became a stronger person within herself over coming some obstacles. 
 
Overall 9.1/10 
Clanand After Story delivered a bunch of good, bad, and ugly moments as well as tearful ones. This is an anime i recommend to anyone who has the heart to watch it. It will leave you with lasting memories.(in my opinion at least). But dont forget to watch Clannad before though. Otherwise it might be confusing to watch.

    What does it mean to lose someone who is very close to you? Is it the world's way of punishing you for something you've done? Or perhaps it may be a way to delve deeper, to find that Illusionary World within ourselves and to embrace the secrets and truths we find there. 
 
Clannad: After Story weaves a deep and heart-breaking tale of the events following the end of Clannad. While watching, you will laugh, you will cry, and most definitely, you will be moved and touched by the way the story is presented and how it progresses. 
 
Now, if you're looking for a cutesy after story that gives us the ""happily ever after"" ending that we all yearn to see, Clannad: After Story does something that I have never seen before. The way the characters are, as well as the added affect of watching them move forwards in their lives lets us, as viewers appeal directly to what happens in the anime.  
 
Evaluation: 
Story: 10/10 
Amazing, heart-breaking, realistic, and a true masterpiece. These are only a few of the words that would accurately describe the storyline behind Clannad: After Story. As I briefly explained above, After Story follows the lives of Tomoya and Nagisa as they move forward with their relationship and onwards to something more significant and special. The scenes are just about perfect, with both happy, funny, and agonizing moments.  
 
Art: 9/10 
Alright, I was being a little picky with art before, but after I really got into After Story, I realized that the art was really, really good. The landscapes, especially that of the Illusionary world were done beautifully, though my low-resolution videos didn't nearly show off all of its splendor. In After Story, what really made the art appeal more to me was Ushio's character. Let's face it. No matter how manly, tough or uncaring you try and appear, you will admit that Ushio is just freaking adorable. 
 
Sound: 10/10 
Once again, the music was great. It was even better than the music from Clannad. I loved the light and barely audible sounds of ""Dango Daikazoku"" in the background, as well as the various scenes where there was no dialogue, just music. The music was just simply, a work of art, and helped me truly appreciate After Story. 
 
Character: 10/10 
I feel that the characters and their personalities in Clannad: After Story is what makes it so good. Every one of them has a quality that we can identify with, essentially putting us in that character's shoes. With that, it is easier for us to, in a sense, ""become"" the character at various places in the story. I don't know about you, but being able to relate to at least one of the characters in a slice-of-life anime like this is what makes the anime so enjoyable. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
Definitely have to give full marks for enjoyment. Though it was extremely heart-wrenching at points, After Story spins such an amazing story with it that you will love it either way. I especially loved the ending, since, well, it wasn't sad. The side story of the girl and the robot was also great, confusing at first, but as the series progresses, you begin to understand the significance of that little story. 
 
Clannad: After Story has definitely been one of the more intricate and worthwhile animes I've watched. Watching has shown me a new way to live my life, teaching me an important life lesson.  
 
Clannad: After Story is definitely a masterpiece to watch. However, I would recommend watching Clannad first, to get a better understanding of what will happen. Beautiful, touching, and heart-wrenching, After story is one series that you cannot miss out on.

    This OVA had great potential to be extremely cute and wholesome, however the team decided to sour the episode with very questionable fanservice. 
 
The anime itself has occasional questionable fanservice, the main target being the preschooler Kanna, but this OVA had more than one uncomfortable fanservice scene. Kobayashi herself, Kanna and Shouta fall into the main anime's more problematic fanservice/shipping themes without the wholesome story to overpower them. 
 
The first half of the OVA is about chocolate gifting. The implications of Kobayashi's actions on Kanna, and later her actions to Tohru, definitely ruined the entire OVA for me personally. 
 
The animation and music are wonderful. It's a shame the story didn't utilize its characters, or the fanservice, in a more appropriate way. 
 
With its cast of attractive adult women, with strong platonic and romantic connections established in the main series, there is no excuse for Tohru's 'gift' or the joking(?) implications after Kobayashi eats it.

    Why am I writing a review for bloopers? Because I'm OCD, that's why. Essentially, what this set of episodes is is a bunch of animated bloopers, each ranging from 1-5 minutes long. 
 
They're all together quite funny, and I think the thing that was enjoyable to me about them is that they really helped me to let go of the series once I had finished it. It lets you go back into the world of these characters without having to rewatch the entire series. Not to mention, you actually get to see some stuff that you wouldn't get to see in the series (like Kuroko laughing). Other than that, though, it's just lighthearted, good fun to watch.  
 
This season of bloopers is probably the best set, in my opinion, and I don't know if that's due to the season's material or not, but I enjoyed this set the most. 
 
Obviously, there's no character development or anything that benefits the story, but it does lighten up some of the more intense moments of the anime, so it's nice to be able to let go of some of that tension. 
 
If you wanna watch it, go ahead. It's fun at the very least.

    The entire point of this OVA is getting the ""Hokago Tea Time"" members performing their very first Public gig. They were invited by Maki, one of the drummers in the band called, ""Love Crisis"" and is also friends with Ritsu and Mio.  
 
Story: 8/10 
Already mentioned It above that basically the entire OVA is getting the girls to perform their first public concert to celebrate the New Year's Eve. 
 
Art: 10/10 
Still the same across all the K-ON Episodes. 
 
Sound: 10/10 
Something you can already hear from previous Season 1 Episodes. Nothing too important. 
 
Character: 10/10 
Its really great to see them working their way to become Pro players. I guess having their first public gig will motivate them even more to reach their goal to go ""Budakon"" as what Yui says (also mentioned at some point in Season 2). 
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
To be honest, they should have played all 4 songs instead of 1. Probably Its because of time constraints, but in my opinion, It wouldn't hurt to make one more OVA to continue off from this. Basically, a Part II for their Live House! concert.  
 
Overall: 8/10 
Still a great OVA, nonetheless. Like I said about more music, I would have liked It to see them Perform all 4 songs. They should have just made this particular OVA a introduction to the Live House! event as well as preparing for the actual concert. Then they should have released a Part II of the OVA to continue off from last Episode where they play all the songs.

    Who doesn't like to know a little history about their favorite characters of their favorite anime? This third InuYasha film, following my favorite one, The Castle beyond the Looking glass, contains a lot about Inuyasha and Sesshoumaru's past. We also get to see what their father looked like, which is something you don't get to see at all in the anime. Each fragment of their past was portrayed in a way that was tied in very well with the anime series, it almost makes you believe that it is canon.  
 
The story is very good, and the action is amazing! Especially the attacks coming from InuYasha's father's sword, the Sounga. Which shows you how great the art in this movie can be. As for the sound, well it's the usual very good, not too different from the OST in the anime seeing as how it was produced by the same man, Wada Kaoru. Although I really enjoyed this movie, I didn;t enjoy it the same way I enjoyed the second movie. It's just a little lower than that. The second movie has everything I wanted in it LOL. 
 
 
Hope you guy enjoy it. It's awesome!

    This was a well done recap. 
It provided it's purpose in making the viewer remember ""Wait, what happened in the first season?"" 
 
It's been so long since I watched the first season, and I really didn't feel like rewatching it to entirety because of how long that would have taken. 
So instead, I've watched the first and second recap movies. 
If you still remember what happened during the first season, this is something you can skip. 
But if you're like me and have absolutely forget the entirety of the story it definitely helps you prepare for season 2. 
 
It smooshes together the first season of 600 minutes, into two movie recaps of 177 minutes. 
So needless to say, there is a lot of detail missing. So if you haven't watched the first season at all and thought to replace it with the recap movies, don't. 
This show is amazing in many ways the recap movies simply can't capture. 
Overall the recap movies are a 6/10 for me, they're just fine. Not a masterpiece in any way and they're only to serve one purpose, not provide new or interesting content.

    GochiUsa was and always has been one series that I've grown particularly fond of since I'd first watched it long ago. It's a sweet moe series that'll probably give you diabetes and heal your soul at the same time, and this movie is essentially not that different from the main series itself. 
 
The plot of the movie is pretty simple and straightforward: Cocoa goes back home for a week to help her mother and sister at their bakery, and of course as a result she and her friends have to have a brief departure from each other. With Kokoa's absence from Rabbit House, we got bits and pieces of character development and backstory glimpses both with Kokoa & her family and Chino & Rize prior to before Cocoa first appears in season one. This movie prioritizes the situation present by having Chino get a chance to properly reflect a bit on her relationships with both Kokoa & Rise separately; with Kokoa's absence, it becomes more apparent that she'd finally had more of an affect than Chino thought, however now that there is a break from Kokoa, this time is used to reflect on how close she'd been with Rize as well, from the moment they first meet to the present moment of this movie. 
 
The characters are the same as their usual selves from the main series for the most part with the exceptional additions of Kokoa's sister Moka & their mother. While Moka made an appearance in the anime for a while, here we not only get a chance to see her more, but all three of the Hoto girls as one and get more of a feel for how connected Kokoa and her family are with each other. 
Along with the main roles besides Chino comes Rize. 
Now, I always felt that Rize might've secretly had the most interesting character of everyone on the main series from what we learn about her prior to this, and here this movie took a good chance to poke a little more into her combat soldier personality and shows more of her true colors outside of her rough love. And her moments were probably the most notable thing in the movie for me because she gets a chance to stand out more than ever. 
 
The animation and sound are on par with that from the main series, even with a new studio behind the series for it's future adaptations, the aesthetic pleasure of the main series' environment are back in play with the scenery of France looking as beautiful and clean as ever along with the simple skippy and cheery background music accompanying it. The song played the first 10 minutes into it and the ending song give the same feeling as the OPs & EDs from before.  
 
Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka??: Dear My Sister does a good job keeping itself consistent by giving off nearly the same vibe as through the first two season, for the most part this movie felt like I was watching an 3 part OVA of the series more than anything because despite this being a movie I never felt like this was one since the main plot of it is something that felt commonplace with the series instead of being much of a standalone work. 
 
With this movie's completion, I can say that I'm confident with the studio switch and look forward to seeing how production doA do with GochiUsa later on through the OVA & 3rd season in the future.

    Surprise! 
 
Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka??: Dear My Sister plot is fairly simple, in which Cocoa goes back home to help her sister, Mocha who has been introduced in the anime series and mother with their new bakery. With this however, the main cast especially Chino feels a bit cocoa sick in the process and within this Chino reminiscence times before Cocoa mainly delving into Rize before the anime series. On Cocoa's side of things well we get to know more about Cocoa's life before the anime series but with the added bakery element into it but mainly Cocoa's screentime is to do with her family, mainly her sister Mocha, her mother does get some screentime but not as much as Mocha does (let alone the interactions between Mocha and Cocoa are much more prevalent than Mocha and her mother). 
 
Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka??: Dear My Sister like many of Manga Time Kirara adaptations has the slice of life element and moe elements down and this movie is no different. Better yet, Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka??: Dear My Sister is like it still kept the essences of the anime series intact even when the movie was going off in something entirely new, in a ways it feels like one entire arc of the anime series taken into one piecemeal hour. 
 
LA really liked the interactions with many of the cast members, from Chino talking about her first interactions with Rize to Rize now being the ""older sister"" to Chino, Maya and Megumi when Cocoa has gone home to Cocoa's interactions with Mocha. The ""Dear My Sister"" of the title is apt to say the least what with Cocoa wanting to be the older sister to Chino but Mocha is also the older sister to Cocoa when she came home and LA's aforementioning of Rize taking up the ""older sister"" in the cafe. The anime series touched on this but Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka??: Dear My Sister is all the more prevalent with this as the theme of the movie. 
 
The animation done now by doA Animation (previously done by White Fox and Kinema Citrus for both anime series'), well doA for the most part kept to the aesthetic of the Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka? with it's European scenery and buildings. The movie's character designs were the same as the anime series but with some level of flair considering what some of the characters go to (as in a festival so some Japanese aesthetic and costumes comes into play). The animation overall was LA expected and returning to Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka? even with a change in studio. 
 
The voice work, well LA really doesn't need to say much considering ALL the voice actors returned for the movie. The only thing would be Mocha voiced by Ai Kayano gotten a bit more screentime in the movie compared to the anime series but that was a given and Ai Kayano is as eccentric as Mocha as ever. LA's favourite character in Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka? and voice actor?, well it's always been Rize and Risa Taneda so yes LA is quite happy that Rize gotten screentime in this movie almost equally as Mocha in this sense. 
 
Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka??: Dear My Sister was what LA expected from a Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka? movie, but with some backstory between certain characters here with ALOT of interactions and hijinks between it's cast and that only sweeten the deal. Yes LA was satisfied with the movie all things considered, from it's character interactions, slice of life plot and the entire ""older sister"" theming the movie had going, it was a pleasantly cute experience much like the anime series.

    Very brief version of a review. The best and worst I observed.  
 
BEST 
-Now's the Empire's turn. Less content for Yang Ling-wei and more for the ""blonde boy"". 
- A new character has appeared. Very expectant. 
- Less battleships scenes, more nasty and bewildering scenes. Be patient at the start. 
 
WORST? 
-It's a summary of the original so they skip a lot with an old-fashioned narration (that I respect, because it keeps the original essence). 
-Things go slow in palace. We have to see the rest for relationships to develop a little more. 
-Some characters just exchange regards or look up to the sky and speak around... one word, aproximately.

    I'll put the TL;DR at the top: This is a great addition to the regular series, and I think it wraps up a couple of the subplots quite nicely. Even though the episodes are only three minutes long, its good for a little pick me up, or you can binge them all together. Like other reviews say, its basically one episode split into six parts, but I think that format works terrifically for these specials.  
 
The specials take on the classic romance anime trope: the beach episode. Now if you've seen the regular series, you know that nothing will go the way you think it will! So if you've seen or are currently watching the series, you should definitely watch these shorts too! Its a great way to wrap up the story, kinda like a nice dessert after a fine meal. I wish I could grow a third hand so that I could give this entire series not two, but THREE thumbs up!

Kid made announcement that he's going to steal a jewelry called ""Artemis no namida (Artemis's tears)"" belongs to a hotel-owner in a certain island; Tsugeshima (Tsuge island). Of course, Inspector Nakamori is on the spot too. Conan, Ran, and Detective Boys taken by Sonoko to that hotel by coincidence. Kid got the jewelry & run succesfully, leaving Conan behind who noticed a strange reactions from the jewelry-owner. So Kid has to face the Detective Boys who mistaken him as Kudo Shinichi, and asked him to join them to catch Kid... that is himself hahahha

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, it was necessary to mention a certain plot points and characters' story lines, since I wanted my criticism to be argumentative. I was waiting for this movie eagerly, especially because I was very intrigued by the new characters of Shibusawa and Fyodor. Bones studio was promoting this movie with a specific emphasis on these two and guess what? Eventually they got almost no screen time and their personalities and motives remained as vague as possible. That’s just a fraud from the movie makers, to bait viewers with posters of a new interesting characters and then reduce their roles almost to the background. And who got all the limelight? Of course it was freaking Atsushi. The movie left me very disappointed and the main reason is this disgusting main character. It’s quite usual for shounen genre MCs to be the most irritating and worst characters among the whole cast. They are usually dumb, shallow and primitive, but always win against all odds with a power of plot shield. Unfortunately, that’s exactly the case for Bungou too. It’s especially sad because there are a lot of much more classy characters in Bungou, and there is a certain character who fits the role of MC a hundred times better than Atsushi - it’s Dazai of course. But instead the author chose to make a loud, dull and hysterical teenager his main hero. Yet the majority of fanbase still like Dazai more, he leads by a wide margin in all fan surveys. Perhaps the problem is with the manga publishers who force authors to create the same stereotypical MCs, since they think that’s what their main audience of teenagers want. But Bungou has more mature, detective feel to its story, so it’s just stupid to force it into the shounen territory with a typical and annoying shounen MC. He just looks out of place here and ruins the whole story. 
 
Almost all problems of this movie are caused by Atsushi and the absurdly large amount of screen time he got while other storylines and characters remained underdeveloped. Atsushi is a very irritating character by himself, but his storyline is also nothing really special. It just doesn’t worth the time wasted on it. Why should we watch how he ‘struggles’ against his freaking tiger (everyone can guess he would win in the end) while Dazai remains in the main antagonist’s castle? Wouldn’t it be much more interesting to follow Dazai’s  storyline more thoroughly? Also Kyouka takes too much time absolutely undeservedly too. She just doesn’t bring anything to the main story. Why is she and her sobby cliche ‘drama’ is even in this movie? She just fills the role of the obligatory boring MC’s girlfriend, but her problems literally have nothing to do with this movie’s plot. Why bring her here? In the battles she didn’t really help, she was like a like a third wheel. 
 
Because of a very small amount of screen time the motives for the two new characters remained more than unclear and vague. I wouldn’t be surprised if they weren’t even thought out properly in the first place. What exactly Shibusawa wanted to achieve with all that abilities collection? It’s also very annoying and stupid how the author tried to tie his story to Atsushi. Apparently he was able to kill Shibusawa in the past and conveniently forgot about it, so they could just pull this amnesia nonsense out of nowhere. He also did it while his ability wasn’t even fully awakened, what an obnoxious mary sue. Shibusawa wanted his power… for some reason. Because he is the MC, right? That’s apparently enough explanation, he is special simply because he is. That actually always amazed me in Bungou - what the hell is so special in Atsushi’s dull ability, since it comes down to the most primitive brute force? Atsushi no doubt has the most boring and uninteresting skill while other characters have much more intriguing powers. So, speaking of Shibusawa, if the author implies that he did everything simply out of boredom - that’s the most lazy and stereotypical explanation possible for the cause of antagonist’s actions. Fyodor’s motive also remained undiscovered, most likely for the author too. Did he try to make an apocalypse by using Shibusawa and his collection? Looks like complete nonsense and again a very primitive banality. But that’s not the characters’ fault, the screenwriter is to blame that he couldn’t come up with a reasonable motivation for such promising and beautifully designed characters. 
 
Shibusawa and Fyodor themselves are wonderful characters, it’s truly sad that because of a little screen time amount they weren’t fully developed. Even a famous voice actors were invited for them. And after the great work of the character designer and VAs, the screenwriter just wasted such remarkable roles. These two deserved much better, the movie creators don’t respect even their own characters who they put on every poster to promoted this movie. Since their motives seem like a simple bad writing, I’ll be considering that Fyodor’s goal was to bring back Shibusawa’s memory. At least then his actions start to make sense. It’s also incredibly annoying and idiotic that author apparently followed the worst shounen cliches and couldn’t allow the MC’s enemies to unite - because if they made a true alliance they would have won against him. If there was a bit of common sense in this plot, there would be no reason for Fyodor to attack Shibusawa, since he could have brought his memory back simply by pressing a crystal on his forehead. He did that in the movie too and that was the cause for the memory return, there was no need for the strike. It was added for useless pathos and to bring discord between them while they should have stayed on the same side and united to bring down the MC since that was what they wanted. Besides, if Shibusawa already revived once even in this ‘ghostly’ form, what was stopping him from doing the same again? Actually nothing. That means the final battle was also pointless and he could have survived. Also it’s especially jarring that before no enemies of the MC and his agency died in anime. Even everyone from the Guild lived though they were practically at war with the agency. And suddenly the screenwriter decided to get rid of the new character, it’s simply not fair since literally every other enemy got to live. 
 
There is also another question concerning plot credibility - why did Shibusawa and Fyodor even allowed Dazai to join them? They know he wasn’t really on their side and acted as a double agent. Was it just for fun, because Shibusawa was bored? Then it’s a very convenient and incredibly forced plot handout for the MC and his team. It’s a distinctive feature of the bad written script, to make characters act intentionally stupid so the MC could win due to their illogical actions. If they acted more rationally, they would be victorious. 
 
The ending was turned into trainwreck. Such an interesting and enigmatic character as Shibusawa was transformed into some kind of a monster, apparently so MC could have won over some ‘scary’ opponent. And it seems he won simply with his retarded screaming, I’m not even joking he screamed like a psycho till the very end of the battle. I got so freaking tired of his instant screaming and loud hysterical reaction to everything during the movie, it made me sick. And of course the author forced Akutagawa to help the MC once again, despite him being Atsushi’s enemy and hating him. It’s so irritating how they make Akutagawa MC’s unwitting ally every time, apparently the author just can’t let somebody truly hate his mary sue MC. 
 
The main plot itself is also worth noticing for its secondary writing, if not to say a plain plagiarism. I think everyone who watched Bleach could easily recognise a Zanpakutou filler arc in this storyline about the abilities gaining their own will and separating from their owners. Akutagawa’s ability even has a very similar design to one of the Zanpakutou, Kazeshini. How is it even possible in the Bungou world to separate the powers from their owners? Nothing like this was ever implied before in the story, these powers are inborn part of a person, it’s not some individual spirits like in case with Zanpakutou. It makes no sense to separate them, where did they get an independent will from? It’s looks like a rip-off from that Bleach arc or at least borrowing of its ideas. Also the screenwriter apparently doesn’t care for the plot consistency even in details - it was said in the beginning of the movie that you can regain your ability only of you defeat it yourself. But in the end Fukuzawa and Mori joined forces and defeated each other’s abilities, and for some reason it worked for them. 
 
All in all the screen time was mostly wasted for Atsushi’s temper tantrums and the primitive shounen cliches. It’s truly upsetting, because as I said before there are so much more worthy characters in Bungou, as well as two new classy  antagonists. I think those two got about five minutes of the total screen time, not counting the ending with transformed Shibusawa. How is it even acceptable? Were there really so many people interested in watching the bland and boring Atsushi with his banal shounen shenanigans? I think not many, and if Dazai was the protagonist, the movie would have been much better even with all those other flaws. Though I guess the movie creators tried to make a distraction from all these plot holes and stupidity with an explicit fanservice, especially with Chuuya. But it can’t hide all problems of this movie.

    I named it ""homosexual shoujo"" 
Simply love it. This is the type of yuri I was searching all my life, so pretty and pure, also like a real lesbian couple and without that ""comedy"" or fanservice included in others of the genre (It's totally respectable, but not my type of yuri...) 
If you're searching for a lesbian romance anime I think this is perfect. I enjoyed it a lot, was like a flash lol, and the art is so sooo beautiful, reminds me a little of Makoto Shinkai films, it has that type of relaxing aura. 
You can empatize well with the characters and her situations, I thinks it's realistic in this point. 
It was a good experience watch this OVA, it's probably that I rewatch it ^^

    I've heard nothing but good things about Asagao to Kase-san, ranging from its frivolous cutesy moments to pure and innocent romantic atmosphere, so I had to check it out for myself to see if it really lived up to the praise it had been receiving. To sum up my thoughts, it did certainly match what people had been saying to a tee, but yet I still left feeling strangely unsatisfied with the experience afterwards. Somehow it didn't sit right with me; maybe I'd expected too much out of a 1-hour OVA and thought it would have more substance than what there actually was, or maybe I felt the relationship portrayed on screen felt underdeveloped and very superficial. Now that I've given it more thought, I'm ready to share how I feel about this OVA and why I thought it struck a lot of high notes, but fumbled a bit in the process of reaching them. 
 
Let's start with what I liked about this anime. First of all, the art and animation is fantastic, pretty much the dictionary definition of eye-candy and adorableness. Though I will say that the character designs were pretty uninspired, definitely not anything we haven't seen before. The cute moments between our main couple Yamada and Kase definitely lived up to and surpassed what I had expected going in, leaving you feeling like you've had your daily sugar intake tripled. Their chemistry and relationship is nothing short of beautiful, and I think it's the prime example of how romance should be portrayed in a light and fluffy manner. The soundtrack is also excellent and worked very well throughout the short runtime of this OVA, choosing a more subtle and serene path initially and slowly working its way up to intensify the dramatic moments. The plane motif which is frequently referenced visually works very well with the core message of the story; that the sun always shines above the clouds, no matter how bad the weather gets below.  
 
However, I also believe that the anime's focus on the ""cute"" moments between our main characters  worked against it just as much as it did in its favor. While I understand that this isn't meant to be a deep story and that many liberties needed to be taken to adapt the story into a 1-hour OVA, the entire runtime of this anime pretty much boils down to a compilation of all the cute moments Yamada and Kase share until the eventual climax. Again, that is exactly the appeal of anime like this, but without the proper development of these characters it fell flat when you're supposed to be getting excited over the relationship of two girls you know basically nothing about, including how they got together in the first place. This is the limitation of having a manga adapted into a short hour-long special, but I do believe that they managed to include the elements of the story that mattered. However I can't help but feel like despite it being a worthwhile experience, it could've been a lot better had it been even an hour longer, or perhaps a full 12 episode long series. With the screentime they got, none of the characters were compelling in any way; all of them were generic cardboard archetypes thrown in with some good romantic chemistry added and then blended up. This is particularly true of Yamada's best friend/generic wingwoman character whom isn't even listed on the MAL page because her role was so insignificant in the narrative. 
 
This anime is meant to appeal to a certain demographic, and that much is obvious. It isn't trying to be a deep story with compelling character arcs or a significant message. It's supposed to be a cute love story between two girls and the challenges they face in their relationship, nothing more. And this anime exceeds with flying colors when it's regarded as that and ONLY that. So, don't be like me and go into this expecting anything else, because the short runtime and aforementioned clear intentions are guaranteed to constrain this anime to what it presents itself to be and thus leave you disappointed like I was. So if you want a very clear and straightforward fluffy romantic story between two fumbling tyros that certainly isn't lacking in the diabetes department, then by all means you will love this anime. But if you want it to rise above that and perhaps be more than what it initially appears to be, you might be in the wrong business.

    ""Once upon a time, there was a boy who couldn't do anything. He's been blessed by the gods and now he can do everything perfectly. The End."" 
Great story right? No? It's too short?! It took me 2 hours to write the story so I thought it would take you guys 2 hours to read my story. My story above is somewhat related to the story of this anime. I said somewhat. 
 
 
 
 
Story (8/10) 
The story is focused on Yui, a girl who is entering high school. She saw an advertisement poster of a ""Light Music Club"" and decided to join the club even though she doesn't know how to play any instruments.  
The story is basically simple. She joins a club, the girls in the club decided to teach her and she learns how to play a guitar. When I said simple, I meant it. There's really nothing much going on every episode. It's just cute girls doing cute things and drinking tea. There's also not much story development which didn't bother me. The reason why my story rating is high because the story is very simple and doesn't require much thinking into it. That's a negative when it comes to other anime but not on this one.  I'm also a fan of ""slice of life"" anime so that's another reason why the story didn't bother me. 
The story pacing is obviously fast considering that the show only had 12 episodes which is acceptable to me. (13 if you count the Extra Episode and 14 if you count the OVA) One episode, they were in Year 1 and another episode, they're celebrating New Years day. 
 
 
 
Art/Animation (8/10) 
The animation is very good.. Not the greatest but I wasn't expecting a perfect animation so it's fine by me. Since the show is all about cute things, the animation used here matched. Although, the use of cliche facial expressions bothered me a bit in the first few episodes but I got used to it. 
 
 
 
Sound (9/10) 
As you know, the show is focused on music. Which means the anime needs to have great music and that's what they exactly did. Most of the music including the opening is great and catchy. Especially that song... What was it called? Ahh, it was Fwafwa Time. The cutest song I've ever heard and Yui singing it makes it even more cuter. One song I didn't like is the ending song. I prefer Mio not singing.  
 
 
 
Character (9/10) 
I did say the characters are cute right? Yes, they are cute and they have different personalities that makes them likable and unique to each other.  
We got Yui, a 15 year old teenage girl and the main protagonist of the show. Yui is the most laziest and weirdest kid you'll ever see. She cannot do anything and her younger sister does the work for her. At first, I thought Yui was the younger sister and Ui was the oldest but it's actually the opposite. Yui plays the guitar despite not knowing how to play it. She later learns how to play it though.  Then we have Mio, a 16 year old teenage girl and one of the main characters of the show. She is a very shy girl and gets easily scared. She plays the bass guitar and does not want to play the lead guitar for reasons that are very obvious . Then we have Ritsu, a 15 year old teenage girl and one of the main characters of the show.  She is a very energetic girl and is friends with Mio for a very long time. She likes to bother Mio most of the time by scaring her. She plays the drums because of her energetic personality. Finally, we have Tsumugi, a 16 year old teenage girl and one of the main characters of the show. She is a calm girl with sweet personality. She is a rich girl which the anime shows a bunch of times and she plays the keyboard. Some might refer to it as the electronic piano but they're both the same. There will be one character who will be introduced later in the show but I don't want to spoil you guys who this character is.  
 
 
 
Enjoyment: (9/10) 
I enjoyed this anime very much. It's a fun and relaxing anime to watch and it's very cute. There are hilarious moments in the show and there are a lot. 
 
 
 
Overall: (8.6/10) (I am not rounding my rating to 9) 
Overall, the anime is fun to watch. It's cute girls doing cute things and the story is very simple. I'm also a bit surprised that there's not a lot of fanservice considering that the cast is all-girls. There is some but not as much and it's not too excessive. My advice to you is don't take this anime seriously. Watch it with an open mind and you'll definitely love this anime. There are some people who are not a fan of slice of life genre. If you're not a fan of slice of life then don't bother watching the show because you're just wasting your time and I'm 99.9% sure you'll just hate it.  
 
 
 
Pros: 
-Simple and cute story 
-Animation is very well done 
-Great soundtrack 
-Great characters 
-Does not take itself seriously 
-A lot of hilarious moments 
 
 
Cons: 
-Yui can be a bit annoying sometimes 
-English Dub uses Japanese honorifics

    Warning to anyone looking to watch this: This season contains rape, in fact it's one of the opening scenes. If you are triggered by that then be advised. 
 
So this season is quite a bit darker than the first season. While the rape scenes are fairly well handled (in the first few eps at least), it does immediately take away from the comedy that I really enjoyed in the first season. That's not to say there were no comedic episodes, but they either felt out of place or weren't well done or both and I don't think I laughed once as opposed to the many, many times I did so in season 1. So those expecting more of what we got in season one will be dissapointed since, once the dragon plot from season 1 is resolved (in a way that was wholly unsatisfying anyway), the show loses its pacing, introduing waay too many new characters and muddling the plot. The first few eps were fairly solid if dark. Some elements were actually pretty damn good. But after episode five things go more and more down hill.  
 
The pacing, tone and character development take a hit, and while it was never boring, and there were a few clever twists I didn't see coming, I did not enjoy myself like I did the first season, in fact I regret watching beyond episode five. (no wait, I regret watching period). 
 
So art: Still pretty solid, plenty of rich backgrounds, and diverse background charavters. The animation while, not quite a popping as in season one, was still very good. So yeah if I was rating solely on art and animation this'd get a much higher grade. 
 
Sound: I didn't care for the opening, but the bg ost was carried over from season 1. Of course later episodes had more than one instace where it was used terribly and there was a complete tonal dissonence between the music and what was playing out on screen. The voice acting (Japanese version) was solid, like the first. 
 
Characters: Here's where things start to go down hill. Development is rushed, and after ep five they stop even trying. The female characters slowly lose most of what made them likable and become the typical, shallow harem sterotypes obssesed with the same guy. Or become damsels to be rescued. While some of the new characters have their moments, those are fleeting and lack impact as the show fails to keep tone and opts to scrap development whenver it's convenient for the plot. I'm sad because I ended up disliking most of the character that I liked in season 1. :( 
 
Story: Missed opportunities, over reliance on coincidences, unfunny and out of place comic relief scenes that are much more mean spirited than in season 1 and generally serve to degrade the main characters. Too many contrived plot twists, to many gross and disturbing scenes (I really did NOT need to see a goblin pig monster satisfy his fetish of licking and bunny girl's leg in the grossest way), to rushed, to unfocused, too many new characters, too many side plots. Just gah this season ruined everything season one had going for it. D: 
 
Final verdict: SKIP IT! seriously save your sanity and pretend it ended with season 1.

    GATE features an engaging story that is unfortunately ruined by the presence of atrocious main characters. These were my sentiments after watching season 1 but I held hope for improvement given since both seasons were rated quite highly. The 2nd seasons failed to create any sort of intrigue behind the main characters since the protagonist, Itami found himself in the same formulaic scenario throughout the show.  
 
Story: 8 
The story line behind this show is honestly the basis for any interest you will ever have. The nation of Japan encounters great difficulties coming to terms with the newly discovered empire. Heavy political, military, and moral dilemmas are presented and they are usually resolved in a very satisfactory manner that shows the people making the decisions have some sort of conflict over the matter. The moral problems however, are extremely predictable in how they are solved and almost exclusively involve Itami. Whenever one of these moral issues occurs, the supporting characters actively point towards Itami for it to be solved. Of course, he always helps whatever issue the poor woman must deal with despite every other character hinting at massive repercussions for his actions. The reason this occurrence becomes a problem is because this is how all moral conflicts are solved in this show, the solution is always to do what you want to do.  
 
Art: 7 
The show features a small amount of CGI that would've been socially unacceptable 3 years ago. But watching this show in 2019 when CGI has been more commonly accepted, the action scenes that use CGI to render tanks, planes, and other vehicles can be well appreciated. This show doesn't impress with a variety of gorgeous scenery or locations, rather it keeps all the events in the story confined to about 5 different settings.  
 
Sound: 5 
The OP isn't terribly enjoyable if you have watched other OPs with heavy electronic music. I can't really say much objectively about this part of the show since sound is very much up to interpretation. From a comparative standpoint (I have watched around 150 shows), I found the music to be rather average. Hence why I have scored this part a 5 
 
Character: 3 
This is the part where minor spoilers may come up about the main characters. I'll leave a spoiler-free TIL at the end of this section. 
 
The order of the following characters is determined by how dreadful I found that character to be. 
 
Piña: 
Piña Co Lada, the princess of the newly discovered empire, staunchly pushes for the peace talks to go through after witnessing the immense power of Japan. The show follows her persistence in convincing her father to pursue an alliance and her vain efforts to protect Japan from the dictatorship. As she is the character that is most in tune with the main story line, she is far more interesting to witness than any side-plot with Itami and his harem. The show also chronicles her fall to despair and dread, showing that her character adapts to what has happened in her kingdom. She is the most developed character out of the entire main cast. 
 
Tuka: 
Tuka Luna Marceau, the only known survivor of her elven village, has to deal with a serious mental condition. She resorts to a believable coping method but one that would be very detrimental in the long run. However when confronted with reality, she adamantly denies it. The problem with this character comes after she has accepted the truth but keeps using that coping method anyway solely for comedic and pandering effect.  
 
Lelei: 
Lelei la Lalena, a 15 year old wizard girl, is an extremely dull character. Very similarly to the first season, her initial role in the story is purely translating/transcribing. Only about half way through the season, she leaves this post (with Itami of course) to go out for reconnaissance. After they complete their main objective, they go to her hometown and we get to meet...her sister and her teacher. What follows is an awful scene where her sister is jealous of Lelei's accomplishments and ponders about Itami's marital status. You can probably guess what the girls around his argue about for about 30 seconds and then never bring up again. What might have saved Lelei's character from being exceedingly monotone would've been her speech at the master's promotion ceremony (I don't remember the exact name). She was pictured to be holding various books after coming back from Japan and one was about chemistry (she called it philosophy). If her white robe thesis speech would've made an intriguing connection to the science of our world, it would've made me believe that she was an interesting character. Instead the viewer is greeted with scene 1: ""You got this Lelei!"" to scene 2: ""How did it go Lelei?"" 
 
Rory: 
Rory Mercury, the apostle of the death god, is a complete travesty of a character. She is a thousand year old goth loli (because anime) and behaves like a cliche teenager for the audience's amusement. Despite being among my most disliked characters in the show, I can't find better words to describe Rory than ""generic"". In both seasons, she is an invincible killing machine that follows Itami wherever he goes. 
 
Itami: 
The protagonist himself is easily the worst of the main cast. He is presented as an die-hard Otaku, a detail that is scarcely brought up unless the author needed it for comedic effect. The problem with Itami is how his behavior remarkably mirrors that of a cliche harem protagonist (oh wait he is one). Watch any number of harem shows and you will have a good idea of how to describe 90% of them with one sentence. Itami is no exception to this trend and it is a tragedy he was chosen to be the main character of the show. Even the story told from the perspective of even one of the soldiers under his command would've been more interesting. 
 
TLDR (Spoiler Free) 
The main cast turns in to a generic harem rom com except Pina. 
 
Enjoyment: 4 
I continued watching to enjoy the development of the main plot, I was thoroughly impressed with the direction it took but I despised the time that was used on Itami and his harem.

    A little discussion about childhood shows on last 2013 with my best friends made one of them tried to search this wonderful show, and re-visit it. And part of my childhood memories had risen since last May 2013. 
Digimon? Yes it is! 
This show was a perfect show for kids, or even for adults, to show them how important friendship and togetherness are, and how to find out your own identity and your specialty, and how important life was, since Digimon showed the interaction between each others perfectly, and showed that lots of Digimon sacrifice themselves (Ex: Angemon and Wizarmon) to save all of them.  
So far, this was my favorite show among another childhood show (Samurai X, Inuyasha, etc) and I did remember that I kept re-watching the same episode over and over again, without feeling bored back then, and I did remember the scene perfectly. 
I'll admit it shyly that I almost forgot the legend song ""Butterfly"" (but luckily I didn't) and I did remember the ending song ""Keep On"" perfectly. 
I'm proud for having this as part of my childhood shows, and childhood memories (cheers 90s!) Now, take my 9 score. Can't wait for Spring 2015!

    The Kase-san manga is one I'm well familiar with. It started in 2010 and was originally meant as a one-shot. But the positive response to it prompted an entire series. In 2018, Zexcs released an hour long OVA. Yes, the same studio behind Cheesesteak Suppository & Umi Monogatari.  
 
Story: 
 
Yamada is on the greenery committee at school. She's started going out with Kase-san, the star of the track team and a girl who's ""way cooler than any boy."" So, this takes uses material from after the first volume of the manga. And it basically goes over a bunch of the events they experience from the second and third volumes of the manga.  
 
The big issue with this as an adaptation is that it skips a lot of the sweeter, more contented moments where Kase and Yamada are just happy and being adorable in favour of showcasing the more ""dramatic"" moments. Which makes it seem more melodramatic than it actually is. It also has the unfortunate side effect of making Kase & Yamada seem really insecure. Yeah, every couple has those moments but when it's the majority of what you see it comes across as worse than when it's a more occasional thing.  
 
That being said, it does a good job of presenting those moments it includes. Albeit a bit abridged. And those more cutesy moments they did include like Kase-san visiting Yamada's house or the pair on the plane do make for some very nice scenes.  
 
Characters: 
 
The big problem here is the insecurity issue. In this OVA, our heroines spend more time being worried about their relationship and thinking it might be about to end than they spend being happy and appreciating each other. And since you don't see how they got together, you don't really know why they bother unless you've read the first volume of the manga and all the happy moments from the second and third volumes that the OVA skipped.  
 
It doesn't help that the characters aren't all that complex and the main draw of the manga is that they're absolutely adorable and their whole dynamic is just a joy to read. Not when the OVA is determined to undermine that aspect as much as possible.  
 
Art: 
 
I do have to give Zexcs credit here. They did a great job of capturing the art style and bringing it to life. Which does make for a very pleasant looking OVA. The characters look good, the animation flows nicely and the backgrounds were nicely filled out.  
 
Sound: 
 
Sakura Ayane & Takahashi Minami do an excellent job in the leading roles. They capture the chemistry betwixt the girls pretty much perfectly and pull off both the more dramatic and cutesy moments handily. The music is nice. Especially the ending duet with our leads.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
This one is all about the les-yay.  
 
Areas of Improvement: 
 
A better job capturing the Manga's aesthetic. Here's the thing, most of the manga is less dramatic, more cutesy. If this OVA had one big dramatic sequence at the end and the rest focused more on cutesy moments, it would better represent what you can expect from the manga and the characters wouldn't come across as so insecure.  
Show the start of the relationship. I get that they don't want to spend much time on it, but it would help our investment if we saw at least a flashback of how they got together rather than having Yamada monologue about it.  
Stronger Supporting Cast. This is an issue with the manga too. We rarely see much of any characters besides Yamada & Kase. The strongest supporting character we get is Mikawa and she mostly shows up when Yamada needs someone to talk about her relationship with.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
I don't recommend letting this OVA be your introduction to Kase-san. Yes, it has its moments but the general focus on the more tumultuous points of their relationship could easily give you the impression that it's a lot more filled with insecurity and generally much weaker than it actually is. If anything, I would say this is a good supplement for the manga. So, if you read the first three volumes and you want to see some of the scenes brought to life, I'd absolutely watch this. But I'd generally go with the manga over the OVA. It's only five volumes and has a lot of cuteness. And that's not including the ongoing follow up manga. For the OVA, I'll give it a 6/10.

    Being an anime fan for 14 years straight, I've refined my tastes over the years, so I know what I like and don't like, and if you like what I don't like, or don't like what I do, that's cool. You win. Everyone has their preferences when it comes to anime/manga. That being said, I've never really been fond of yaoi or yuri manga, and that's because many of them tend to play up the sex too much, especially sex that's dubiously consensual at best, are just poorly written in general, and don't necessarily reflect the experiences that actual LGBT people go through, since those works aren't written with that audience in mind. For me, they've just never been my thing. However, like any form of media, there are exceptions to the rule, and some of the more recent yaoi/yuri/shounen-ai/shoujo-ai stories are making an effort to actually be good and high quality, such as Shimanami Tasogare, Aoi Hana, Bloom Into You, and for today's subject, a little OVA called Kase-san and Morning Glories, based on the manga by Hiromi Takashima. I've only read two volumes of the manga, so I won't be commenting on that. 
 
The OVA centers around two girls, shy gardener Yui Yamada, and popular sporty track star, Tomoka Kase. At first, the two barely know the other exists, but after a few meetings in school, they gradually become friends and start spending a lot of time together. Over time, the two find themselves crushing on each other, realizing they love each other, and after some initial awkwardness, they eventually decide to start dating. The OVA begins after they start dating, so they're technically already in a relationship at this point, so it focuses more on how they deal with their romantic feelings, the awkwardness that comes from being in a relationship, and showing how they work together as a couple, so there's a heavy focus on character driven conflict. 
 
The OVA is only 50 minutes long, just short of an hour, but it's slowly paced in that it focuses a lot on the girls' lives, finding wonder in mundane things such as talking to your loved ones and going on vacation to a sunny beachside, and putting heavy emphasis on setting up a mellow, soft atmosphere. The animation sells it wonderfully, with bright colors, subtle but smooth character movement, great use of light and shadows, and giving the whole series a warm, welcoming palette. If you're not the patient type or someone who prefers heart pumping action and stuff happening all the time, then this isn't the show for you. It takes its time to really flesh out the leads and show their relationship evolving. 
 
Honestly, while I do like the main characters, and their chemistry is really nice to watch, they don't really get fleshed out all that much. I mean, this is a 50-minute episode that leaves out a lot of important details from the manga, so this is inevitable. But I think the characters suffered quite a bit in the transition. Granted, I've only read two volumes of the manga thus far, and while they're not poorly executed or anything, they do come off as rather one note archetypes, with Yamada being the shy girl, Kase being the sporty energetic one, Mikawa being the typical spunky friend character who snarks a lot, so on and so forth. I've seen them done worse, but Kase-san doesn't really try to do anything with them other than play them straight, without doing anything to spice it up or make them somewhat interesting. 
 
Plus, you'll find a lot of romance tropes used here that may or may not annoy you, such as a bunch of misunderstandings that don't get cleared up right away, the girls not always walking to each other about important things, sexual advances getting interrupted, melodrama resulting from things getting blown out of proportion, and so on. Granted, it does manage to do these things much less obnoxiously than most TV shows I've seen, so I'm willing to cut it some slack on that, but for those who utterly hate these things overall, you should probably look elsewhere. Furthermore, the anime is very fluffy and lighthearted, focusing heavily on cuteness, fluff, and sweetness than the downsides of being in a relationship, which is totally fine if done well, and in this day and age, we need more stories about LGBT people that don't involve lots of angst and drama. However, piling on too much sugar can detriment a product more than anything, and I like that Kase-san is trying to present a lesbian relationship in a sweet, positive light, I feel like the short length of the anime rendered any growth and chemistry the characters developed to be rather shallow, as we don't see them actively trying to work together or encounter genuine problems that could require them to strengthen their relationship. Romance isn't all rainbows and unicorns, you guys. 
 
But for what it's worth, it's still a sweet, fluffy shoujo-ai anime that you can watch if you just want to relax and dream of good days ahead.

    This is a nostalgia free review.  
This review will have some spoiler too 
 
Story: 7 young kids ( soon to be 8) get trap in the digital world find their digimon to fight the bad guys. That's it. Short simple and they done a fantastic job telling the story. There is also some drama to it. Not just with each other or with their digimon. But we have parents divorce and Koushiro (Izzy)learn being adopted. 
 
Art and animation: Nothing to talk much here. The art is 100% hand drawn and still look good till these days 
 
Character: There is 8 human characters, 8 digimon and still balance it very well. Still have good character developments. Not just the main 16 character but also the side cast being the parents. Such as Takeru (TK) mom and sora mom. Each characters in this anime have their own personality that we all can reflect on. For example, Taichi (Tai) being the courageous fellow who thinks about the action first before learning the consequences of his action. Or Sora being the person that can't understand her mother love. 
 
Enjoyment: As you can tell by this review. This anime is a must watch not for the younger generation or people who grew up with this series in the 90's. It have such great moral lessons that even adults can learn.  
 
Overall: This is anime is must watch not for the nostalgia favorite but for all

    This anime is one from my childhood, and I absolutely love it! I remember watching it when I was about 12 / 13 years old and I can still go back to it today with the same enjoyment. 
 
For an anime that is focused on children, it tends to be surprisingly deep. It is very emotional with fair morals to be taught.  
 
Friendship, honesty, hard work, TEAM-work, etc are all in the foundation of this series. After watching both the American version and the original (subbed) I can say I am pleasantly surprised by both.  
 
The characters are fun and interesting to watch and there are a lot of comedy-gold moments throughout the series. There are however an equal amount of heart-string pulling moments that will break your heart. 
 
If you watched this growing up you will probably understand, if you have a toddler or child I would recommend this anime to you.

    As a whole, Digimon is a pretty good, but very flawed, show. Unlike most, I actually do not consider it to be better than Pokemon- it is much more consistent, but the former does most things better than it. 
 
Pros: 
- The storylines are usually interesting, and there's several cool sci-fi episodes.  
- Very consistent and not much filler. Most episodes are plot important in some way or another. I can count the filler episodes on at most two hands. 
 
Cons: 
- The show is usually not good at humor. At least in the dub most of the jokes are lame puns.  
- The show is not really good at creating an epic atmosphere. Many episodes which should be great to excellent are just Good. The main flaw is that the animation and direction are mediocre and can often not give episodes the epic feeling they should have. 
- The show is not really good at creating emotional moments. Some episodes packed a nice emotional punch but for example most of the death scenes were nowhere NEAR as emotional as they should be. 
- Mimi and Tai are annoying. 
 
Regardless of these flaws, I was still able to decently enjoy the show. Anyone who likes this sort of thing should be able to as well.

    I remember when this first came out in north america i used to get up everyday to watch it from the first to the last episode. I loved this anime, i still do and i can still remember why so this is gonna be a fair review. 
 
The story starts off very small, it seems like its gonna be a short show only last a little bit but no the first seasons more or less a introduction to the world. It is just showing you the mechanics and typical returning bits for the show. After you watch past the first story arc each plot from there on gets more intense and interesting till it builds to a pretty great climactic end.  
 
And then its still not over cause you get the direct sequel to this show in Digimon Adventure 2 with a new main cast sadly.....but you get the old cast as supporting! so check that out too after you've watched this. 
 
The art style has a lot of sharper colors and simpler character designs. Very few of the actual monsters have too much detail, some of them are just plain simple. I feel the biomes in season 1 and the city designs in the later part of the show were the best drawn things involved. A very nice world all around, very creative. 
 
I enjoyed digimon a lot, it was a charming show of my youth and i still play the games and such now that i am older. I think even a mature audience will appreciate this show in the same way people appreciate pokemon still. Reminds me of a simpler time and all that. Anyway digimon is a great show solid 8 for me.

     Brief Synopsis 
 
Digimon Adventure 01 or more simply known as Digimon season 1 in North America is about seven who  have gone to camp for the summer when it starts snowing. While snowing seven mysterious gadgets fall from the sky. When they pick them up, they are transported to another world. When they wake up in this world, they are not really sure where they are. All they know is each one of them has this tiny creature following them around who introduce themselves as digital monsters, or digimon for short. Upon arrival they also meet their first enemy, Kwagamon, a huge digimon who chases the eight children onto a cliff. With nowhere else to turn their digimon partners begin attacking the Kwagamon. Their digimon though, are too small and not powerful enough to even put a scratch on it and get sent flying back when Kwagamon strikes back. The children rush over to their hurt partners as Kwagamon gets ready to attack again. With the children frightened they stand tall to fight again. That's when a light shines down upon each of their digimon. Each changes to a new form. With this new stronger form, the seven digimon are able to push back Kwagamon. The children later learn that this process in which the digimon change is called digivolving. This is made possible through their digivices; the gadgets which they received from before. The digivices are also how they were transported to this new world, the Digital World. As the series continues the seven children, known as the digidestined, find many new adventures while facing many new enemies and challenges. As the children get stronger, those enemies and challenges also become stronger. One of their most challenging obstacles is one another. They soon learn that to get back home, they will have to put aside their differences and work as a team; and it is definitely easier said than done. The enemies they meet challenge their teamwork even greater. They push the children to their limits; even when they meet the mysterious eighth digidestined. But with their digimon to help them along, they know they can overcome every challenge they're faced with. 
 
Review 
 
Story 9/10 
 
A survival story where people get pulled into a new and mysterious world is by no means a new idea, but what matters is how its put together. The story seemed to flow smoothly from start to finish. That is not an easy thing to do. The way the author created the many types of digimon, their digivolutions, and even the world where they lived was imaginative. All in all the story along with the characters, made for a very enjoyable series. 
 
Characters 8/10 
 
There are many characters in this series. I will briefly describe the main ones: 
 
Protagonists 
 
Taichi ""Tai"" Kamiya - He is the fearless leader of the digidestined. He is stubborn and quick to act without thinking, but cares deeply about his friends. His digimon partner is Agumon.

Sora Takenouchi - The tomboy who is the motherly figure of the group. Someone everyone looks up to. Her digimon partner is Biyomon. 
 
Mimi Tachikawa - The spoiled rich girl who always complains, but is also sensitive and caring. She grows the most throughout the series. It can also be said she is the most ""real"" character. Her digimon partner is Palmon. 
 
Koshiro ""Izzy"" Izumi - The brain of the group. He is always looked to when there's a problem. His digimon partner is Tentomon. 
 
Joe Kido - The reliable guy who is always prepared no matter the situation. He worries a lot about danger and tries to act of the voice of reason, even though most of the time the others don't listen. His digimon partner is Gomamon. 
 
Takeru ""TK"" Takashi. - Matt's younger brother. He is always smiling. As he grows up, he becomes more dependable. His digimon partner is Patamon. 
 
Hikari ""Kari"" Kagiyama - Tai's younger sister. She is kind and gentle. Her digimon partner is Gatomon. 
 
Antagonists

Piedmon - The leader of the Dark Masters.He is the most cruel and sadistic. His method of killing uses deception and trickery. 
 
Art 7/10 
 
The art style gives this series a unique flare. It's American and Japan cartoon style almost mixed together.. It definitely might not be the best animation ever but considering this series was from the 90's, they did a pretty decent job. Either way Digimon's style stands out from other animation and you can tell their original signature style anywhere. What I mean by original is that unfortunately a few seasons later the animators decide that they need to change the so well known style. 
 
Sounds 8/10 
 
1) Soundtrack 
 
The Japanese soundtrack is better. The opening Butterfly being one of my fave anime openings of all time. But the English opening is one that is very recognizable and gives you a feeling of nostalgia if you watched it when you were younger. 
 
2) Voice Acting 
 
The voice acting was a lot smoother in the Japanese dub. The English I find a bit annoying now when I go back and watch it. As a kid I did not notice much since I, well, was a kid. But I'll admit it's one of 4Kids ""better dubs"". 
 
Enjoyment and Overall 9/10 
 
I very much enjoyed this series. It was humorous and light but also had its more serious and dark moments. I would recommend this series to anyone. If your older and can read sub-titles, I would definitely give the Japanses/English Subbed version a try.

    First of all, not everyone might like the Anime ""K-ON"" because of it's moe characters, but for me everything in this anime is really good animated, particularly the scences where they play their instruments.  
 
Moreover, the story is really cute, but also all of the characters, including the one's, which are ""just"" supporting.  
 
Also the music which is shown is also a factor that makes me love this anime. Every single song is really cute and not compareable with the others.  
 
All in all, K-ON is an anime which is really outstanding and something special. I enjoyed every single episode and I definitely would watch it again. It's definitely worth a peek!

    K-On! is a brilliant, yet simple telling of lovable, incredibly real characters and their exploits. What K-On! excels in is not its storytelling or any deep philosophical themes, but rather in how unbelievably real and relatable the characters are written and animated. The environments are also extremely detailed and accurate; I’d suggest looking at videos comparing the anime to the city it’s based on. 
 
The characters in K-On! all stand by themselves as concrete and likable. I wouldn’t doubt anyone would kill so see an entire series dedicated to their favorite character. Personally, this is the first series I’ve seen where I can’t pinpoint a ‘favorite’ character. I can think of multiple reasons as to why four of the five characters would be my favorite (I was not too fond of the Azusa). However, what makes K-On! transcend other similar anime is not how awesome the characters are, but the way they interact with one another.  All of the girls in K-On! grow individually, as well written characters should, but they very visually also grow as a group. They naturally influence each other and the people around them in a manner that is almost never accurately depicted in fiction. This type of character development is sometimes pointed out by Azusa, which is probably why I didn’t like her.  And, even though there is an entire arc dedicated to this idea, I believe it’s more effectively done throughout the series as a whole. “The power of friendship,” is usually brought up upon in reviews with negative connotation, but in this case, and perhaps solely this case, it’s an amazing thing. The way in which the girls change each other truly does show the power of friendship. All of the girls overcome some part of themselves, brilliantly, subtly so, through the influence of the other girls. I would argue that the main theme of the anime is exactly that, though the ‘coming of age’ part of it is also done really well.  
 
If I were to give a rating solely on how much I loved this anime and its characters, I would give it a 10; however, I simply can’t say it’s as “good” as the animes I would consider to be 9s or 10s. I would still give it my highest recommendation for anyone that wants to witness what character animation and subtle character development should ideally be, as well as to anyone that wants to see a fun, lighthearted anime.

    For starters, I'll make it short : ""K-On!"" is not an ambitious anime, BUT it reaches its goal, which is to entertain the spectator. This makes it far better than all those anime which try to be smart or serious when they're not. 
There is not much of a story, it's just about the everyday life of high-school girls. There is few development as well. BUT chara-development does exist, which makes the main characters enjoyable : they aren't just stereotypes with no story, they are consistent enough to be pleasant. 
But ""K-ON!"" is definitely not for people who are looking for deep stories and chara-development. They are for those who just want to be distracted for a while. 
This show succeeds in entertaining the viewer thanks to wonderful graphics and sounds, funny characters, awesome staging and hilarious situations. 
 
 
Now, here is the long version : 
 
STORY: 
""K-On!"" is about the life of high-school girls forming a music club, and... that's all. The episodes just show those girls living their high-school years, studying for their exams, taking vacation breaks, and hanging around while sometimes working for their club activities. 
I'll be blunt : if you're looking for a deep, complex, developed story, you definitely won't enjoy this anime. But if you can understand that story is not everything in an anime, you will see all the good points that make this show really enjoyable. 
The one major flaw I see in this anime's story is the rythm. ""K-On!"" is composed of a 14 episodes season, and a 27 episodes season (along with a movie, which takes place before the last episodes), covering three years of those girls lives. 
BUT the first 2 years are actually covered by the 1st season, and the last year is covered by the 2nd one. 
As a result, the first two years are way too short! This is really stupid! It just feels like nothing happens in those two years, which makes me feel that the first season is way too short for what it's telling. 
 
ART : 
For a 2010-ish anime, ""K-On!"" is absolutely gorgeous. The chara-design is fairly simple, but the backgrounds are great (although classic : most of the anime is staged in an average japanese high-school), the light effects are beautiful and the animation is quite flawless... except in the first season, where it is sometimes disgusting. But the second season and the movie have an awesome animation, at least for an 8-year old anime. 
 
SOUND :  
Visually it is well done, but the sound is also great. The OST is simple but very well used (it plays a major role in comedic scenes). The songs (whether that be the openings, the endings, or the insert songs) are absolutely awesome : ""K-On!"" offers a lot of purely orchestral, rock'n'roll songs. 
It is interesting to notice that the quality of the insert songs is generally lowered in the episodes. This is actually a great idea : remember, the characters are average high-schoolers, not music genius! 
Because of that, and because they are supposed to play in live during their concerts, the girls don't play their songs perfectly. Of course, in the real OST, the songs are much better than what can be heard during the episodes! 
 
COMEDY : 
Humor in ""K-On!"" is terrific. Of course it is subjective, but we can't say they didn't pull a lot of comedic strings : 
- Yui's clumsy behaviour : it's not only cute, it's also fun because whatever happens, you just know that Yui will fail at something xD. 
- Overdramatic scenes : many scenes are played as dramatic stuff when it really is nothing serious. 
That offset is often used in popular comedic stuff (I'll just cite One Punch Man, where many scenes are taken seriously by the characters whereas it's just plain stupid situations... and that's why this show is so funny!). 
- Characters interactions : there is so much to say on that : the fact that Ui (Yui's little sister) is actually mature (when it should be her big sister who takes this role), the fact that Ritsu keeps teasing Mio, the fact that Mugi is impressed by anything normal (as a rich girl, she didn't live a normal life, thus she loves having the opportunity to do ""normal stuff"" like going to a cheap store or eating at a fast-food), the fact that Azusa, which takes music seriously, winds up in a lazy club like this, and so on. 
- Ordinarity : yes, seing something ordinary can be funny. It can be funny to see a character struggle with problems that we had before. It can be funny to see a character in a situation that we have been in before. 
It is just appealing. 
 
CHARACTERS : 
Overall, there is few development on the characters, as there is no story to make them evolve. That doesn't mean there is nothing though : Yui learns to get over her clumsiness (although just a bit), Mio learns to get over her shyness, Mugi learns to ""live normally"", Azusa learns to be less strict, and the best of all, Sawako learns that her past is not that shameful... 
No, we definitely can't say that there is no development at all. But that's simply not the point of this series. 
 
I think I talked about everything. Sure, ""K-On!"" is simple and cliché, and there is almost no story in it. But it compensates for it with almost everything else : enjoyable characters, great visuals and songs, and hilarious situations. This is more than enough to make it memorable and fairly enjoyable.

    Basically a classic. Without knowing anything about this show, it might be a kind of basic cute girls doing cute things type of show. 
The thing is, it kind of is, but it's THE show that made this genre make a huge boom in the first place, or at least one of the shows. It's popular. Super popular. And I mean, if I watched this in 2009, I would be too. So I play homage to this show, and watched it just now.  
Honestly, kind of boring, but you have to understand that the reason its boring is because I've already watched shows like this before, but this show was the reasons those shows were even made. 
So, its got a lot of cliches, but it invented the cliches. So, is it really cliche then? 
Lastly, the art is pretty damn good honestly, wouldn't think it was a 2009 show unless I checked. Up to standard that's for sure.  
Anyways, if you like the genre you will like it. For me, The genre isn't really my cup of tea most of the time, but I will give it an 8 to give respects to the origins. A 6, if  I am being completely objective.

    So, this kind of typical anime which I like more instead of other anime that I've ever watched. Every time, I always look for anime with a typical story like this, doesn't really need the main plot, just a bunch of cute girls doing some cute things. This is the first slice of life anime I've ever watched and was an anime that made me love the genre. I mean, not everyone wants to watch anime with stories like this, no male characters at all, and need a process to get someone to get into this anime. K-On! is an anime that discusses a group of girls who love music with their daily activities at their music clubs. 
 
If you want to find something that has a confidence from beginning to the end, you're wrong. I don't really understand why people who didn't understand aba out slice of life thing that has no plot or plotless. Just like Lucky☆Star, everyone assumes the same as these two anime. The story is nothing special, just a bunch of girls who are enjoying their school days by being in the ""light music club"" and doing all sorts of ordinary things. It's a typical slice of life which mixed with comedy as well as something related to moe or kinda like that. This is a big step considering that many people didn't like the manga, KyoAni adapted the manga and made the anime version better. It's about music if you just want to read the manga which I think manga with music genre is so weird because you can't hear ""the music."" For me, this is the show that always makes me laugh every second, every minute of the episode. 
 
The art is cute and has its own characteristic of KyoAni. This studio always presents a heroine character that contains their actuating. The moe's part it's memorable from every depiction of the character and the background. Supported with all aspects from all of the famous seiyuu as well, I think the art is more like to be some sweetheart that you want to hug all of them and forget anything about life. 
 
All soundtracks are so catchy to hear. I think almost all the songs that I downloaded over the internet, especially with the opening and ending song. Sakurakou Keion-bu, whose members are Aki Toyosaki, Yoko Hisaka, Satomi Satou, and Minako Kotobuki all participate in their cute voice. However, I like the opening but not so memorable than the ending. I don't have anything about Aki Toyosaki and Yui Hirasawa for being detached which I also like her personality and her character. For the ending song, this is the best which I love Yoko Hikasa who's more seen as the lead singer than Aki. Both have their own uniqueness of their voices and there must be one that some make us annoying. It's enjoyable because it's more instruments to light rock and make it all different from the others. Ayana Taketatsu, Minako Kotobuki, and Satomi Sato are also great at filling their characters. 
 
Apart from the 5 main characters and heroines, the characters have different characteristics and have their own uniqueness. For the whole story, we will focus more on Yui Hirasawa, a lazy and always carefree. Her behavior is always doing weird things that make herself have her own cute side. Mio Akiyama, the opposite character of Yui, who is shy and easily scared but she is just like any other character that makes her have an attractive side. Ritsu Tainaka, energetic and always prank her childhood friend, Mio. Tsugumi Kotobuki, her seemingly ordinary but innocent in every way because of her luxurious life but her character doesn't really reflect a rich people in general. Although like that, she also has the other side of uniqueness. Azusa Nakano, her serious nature but easily distracted by everything including from Yui who always approached her. 
 
It's really hard to get into this anime because this is suggested by one of my friends who has been watching anime like this for a long time. However, the comedy itself never made me dropped so I always feel it at every episode. It's pretty good for some people because people are definitely still hard to accept anime like this considering all the characters in here are just women without any men. At last, men only become a cameo for every tiny role. There is a separate process and a willingness to be able to watch anime cute girls doing cute things besides K-On! but this is the right step if you want to know anything about typical anime like this. 
 
K-On! is an anime with their cute characters and does cute stuff. This anime doesn't really need the core of the story, there is no seriousness to be able to enjoy it because you can turn off your brain and stop enjoying some anime with a complex story that you always into it. With waifuable characters, I think I'm also not surprised at the community and the internet love this. It's a lot of fun since you just wanna enjoy some plotless thing like this but it's worth it.

    Here's my take on the 12 + episodes of K-On Season 1 by Kyoto Animation Studios. 
 
Let me say first that this anime is surprisingly fresh and bubbly all through out episode 1 up to the last episode of this light music anime. 
 
I do not normally like watching slice of life anime nor anime that are music or arts based, but I still tried it with K-On and it was not a waste of my limited free time. 
 
The story is about a Ritsu and Mio's desire to be a part of a light music band in their school. When they noticed that they didn't have enough members even after they got the heart of Tsumugi. They set their eyes on Yui a freshmen who stumbled on their club room thinking that it would be fun to play the castanet, but unbeknownst to her that she would run into the path of becoming their lead guitarist/vocalist.  
 
It was a breath of fresh air for me which I really needed to unwind. The story was sugar, spice and everything nice all mashed together into every episode. I love how the overall theme of the musical band/high school life were represented. 
 
The art was good and not too flashy which it needed. Sound and music is one of the best part of K-On as they are all quirky and fun watch and listen to.  
 
Yui and the gang all stand out in their own zany way and I just love Mio's reaction Ritsu's pranks, Yui's clumsy moments and Nodoka!! Just gotta love a bespectacled character in every anime. 
 
All in all, K-On is an easy binge watch, and you would not regret every bit of their antics per episode. 
 
I would give K-On 9 Gitaa out of 10. <3

    K-On!, what a satisfying and enjoyable music series 
 
Before I started on K-On! I just ended the long series of Beck, and I must say I was left kinda disappointed. At that time I was craving a music anime series to binge on and K-On! popped on my recommendation. So, verdict? I must say I am pleased and the show is pretty good. The songs that were used are such addicting J-pop/ J-rock songs, they are catchy and have awesome guitar riffs. Not even from watching the first episode, I knew this was going to be a great series after the hearing the sick intro. Like seriously, the beginning guitar riffs sounds like a intro to a action-fighting series, awesome. Plus the details they put into this show is just so meticulous, from the new intro adding the new guitar riffs from Azu-nyan to the pin-point expressions shown is just amazing. What shocks me even more is that this was made in 2010! Like, wow, the show showed zero signs of under production and even presented us with 'extras' to prove that the show has more than enough production support. I definitely have more to say but I feel that you after watching the show should get where I am coming from. 
 
-SCORES- 
 
Character- 8/10: The characters are, how do I put it, fantastic. Majority of the show is packed with stuff and it presents us with content that the characters face. The show does well at presenting the different characteristics of each member and even side characters. Even showing amazing bonds and interactions with each of the characters, from the close bonds of Mio and Azu-nyan, Yui and Ritsu moreover the neutral-lovely Mugi to balance the ground out. The show presents siblings bond with Yui and Ui as sisters and the different sides of a person such as the once-thought-kind teacher, Sawako. However, I do get where people are coming from when they might think of the characters as too noisy or too childish and so on... But I see it as the show just proving, to us the viewer, that it has content to give and not trying to waste as much time till the show ends. I personality adore the bonds with all the childish gigs they do, cause I seriously feel that that would be me in that situation. Just enjoying my youth and having fun with friends. Some issues I face is pretty minor, such as the wish to incorporate more male characters, I say this because the environment just feels off without the presents of at least some continuous appearing male characters. Another is the Mio's off and on shyness, I feel this could be presented slightly better as to not make her so damn shy, like I wished they showed development of her becoming more braver, but this might happen in the new season. Lastly, off to another topic, Mugi is be girl and those who disagree with me is fair to do so. 
 
Art- 9/10: Damn man, this art is good stuff, like eye-candy to me. While the character design can be questionable due to the repetition of the same design for other animes, such as 'So Ra No Wo To' and the use of double clips in Yui's hair, this is in fault on the manga but, I must say the studio did a damn well job on animating them. They are lively and funny, movement when playing their instruments are top notch. Yes their eyes are big, yes they have no nose, and yes their hair is like solids, but, the studio place the design on second priority and place movement and flow of the characters first. This is what makes the show's flow and pacing incredible. Background art is nice, not much to say but it's done well.  
 
Writing- 7/10: This, I must say, the shows weakest, but it is by far well above average from other series. What I wish was a more interesting story but what they present wasn't at all bad. Like even in the extras, the first one, the power of something somewhat ridiculous and bring people together and place a smile on their faces is truly captivating. I know that what they are showing is adaptation so I'm somewhat ranting all the bad things about the manga. But I know the show definitely could present it in a much enjoyable way. I'm just eager to see what happens in the movie and the second season. 
 
Sound- 8/10: This is a no complain on the sound, like they did it well, with a nice OST to fit behind the whole show. Sound of the songs are honestly great, voices are clear and melodies are catchy. 
 
Overall, a show well done. Pleased with the result and definitely looking forward to the next movie and season. I really do wish they would bring in a love plot cause that be so fan-servicing for me. Recommend this, a music series done fantastically well. 
 
Decent to light 8

    The spiritual successor that Seinfeld never wanted, this truly is a show about nothing. Girls initially pretending to be interested in music get to together to eat sweets and call each other nick names. There is no real dialogue or story or content. The author simply copy and pasted 5 generic anime girls, made a list of all the food they liked, and then proceeded to dictate that list to us. Writhing at the thought of doing anything other than this, the author eventually caves and makes his characters ""play a show"" that they never practiced for, but absolutely ""rock the house"". There is nothing else to continue this review. 
 
Art is standard. Sound is standard. This show is a complete waste of time.

    It's all about perspective. You could say this series caters for the tastes of hardcore otaku in their mid-20's, and most people think it does. I, however, think it's the kind of show you could, without any sense of shame or guilt, watch with multiple generations of your family. They'll probably enjoy it for what it is, a fun show. 
 
I am aware, though, that I am in my early 30's and people will say ""yeah, but you're just hiding your fanboy-ness"", but I'm actually not. 
 
The story, as goes with the SoL territory, is not really a story at all, just scenes played out following a group of high school girls playing j-pop. Yep, that's the story. 
 
On the sound front, you'd expect good things given the premise of the show and it delivers well, with good, catchy j-pop all throughout. 
 
The characters are pretty decent tropes given flesh until you get to Mio, who I have to give extra points. Not exactly being the most confident of people made her relatable to me. Also, the animation is really solid. KyoAni have done really well here, in all departments.

    This is oficially the worst and the most boring anime that i've ever watched. 
Seriously, it's awful. 
 
Story 1/10: 
 
Story? Is there even a one? 
Main character Yui needs to join a club, so she decided to join Light Music Club (even tho, she can't really play guitar). The first episode was like ,,oh my god! what's happening? will the main character learn how to play well?'' and some of their concerts (like, there's not many of them) were like that but the rest of the ,,action'' was just sitting in their club room, eating sweets and doing stupid stuff. 
 
Art 4/10: 
 
The art itself, is pretty nice to watch. The characters have the right anatomy, everything is fine but if you will look at it often it will begin to be boring, and you will notice the same face syndrome. 
 
Sound 6/10: 
 
For a music type of show, the songs were pretty catchy and great. There weren't that much of them sadly. 
 
Character 1/10: 
 
Mio Akiyama - scared of frickin' seashells, she plays the bass and she's left handed. Moe or something. 
 
Yui Hirasawa - main character. Annoying as hell, just joined the club and she doesn't do anything. She beats Sans in the level of laziness. 
 
Azusa Nakano - i can't really say anything about this character because it's plain. She plays guitar 
 
Tsumugi Kotobuki - she plays the keyboard and bring sweets. That's it. 
 
Ritsu Tainaka - she plays the drums and tries to make everyone happy and energetic, she's the cog of the show.  
 
Enjoyment 2/10: 
 
Really hard to watch, sometimes you just want to quit. The concert episodes tho, were pretty decent to watch.  
 
Overall 1/10: 
 
If you like shows about being lazy, eating sweets, doing some music but ocasionally, then go ahead but if you would like it to be more energetic then i reccomend to watch Zombieland Saga, it's pretty similiar but the girls are energetic and there's a story.

    Review in brief: 
 
K-On!'s 1st season cemented much of what are now seen as the quintessential elements of the CGDCT subgenre. Rather than bring anything new to the table, K-On! distilled what had already been done into something that's easy to relate to without sacrificing much in the way of characterization, comedy, and plain old fun. 
 
Review in full: 
 
K-On, like most of what is found in the CGDCT (Cute Girls Doing Cute Things) subgenre, isn't really about anything.  Sure, there's themes that are lightly touched on, and sometimes they play music, but the story isn't the main point.  K-On is far from the first CGDCT anime to come about and was hardly an innovator in its field.  That distinction is generally given to Azumanga Daioh, whose blend of loose (often to the point of being surreal) comedy and iyashikei (healing) undertones set a precedent that has largely remained followed since it started as a manga 20 years ago.  Aside from being much less surreal, K-On!'s style is fairly standard even for its time, much more so these days when it's been done multiple times per season for years. 
 
Yet K-On! is a much beloved anime and a worthwhile entry point into its subgenre to this day.  This season may not stand out against many of its peers, but it certainly provides a lighthearted, friendly experience and it does this especially consistently.  K-On! not having much of a focal point actually plays to its benefit, as it allows the anime to take full advantage of its simplicity.  Sure, it lacks the narrative depth you'd expect from something more focused on its plot, but K-On! isn't as shallow as it looks and goes as deep as it needs to for it to provide an all-around fun time. 
 
Rather than try and compose anything poignant or grandiose, K-On! simply tries to bring about a smile through its calming normalcy and general goofiness. It does a splendid job of capturing the air of an after-school club with close friends, often subject to goofing off and enjoying each other's company rather than focus on just the club activity which, while a shared interest, is but a single facet in the relationships of its members.  Virtually anyone who has been part of a close group of friends can relate to it, and those who haven't can easily get an understanding of what would make such an arrangement a fun and worthwhile venture. 
 
Since we've established that the ""cute things"" being done aren't the important part, it's the ""cute girls"" that are the main appeal.  Of course they're visually cute, but this isn't an ecchi title and the resulting innocent nature of the anime is part of the charm.  No, it's the selection of cute personalities playing off each other that's important.  The quirky but rarely over-the-top bunch of goofballs in K-On! definitely get the job done.  Sure they're initially defined by a handful of personality traits, but most of the cast supplement each other's quirks over the course of the season, allowing them to flesh out quite nicely and even lightly develop. 
 
For instance, Mio has stage fright and doesn't like costumes, but there's some costumes she dislikes more than others and the difference between performing for her friends versus the whole school is clear.  From there, K-On! builds on those traits by having her become accustomed to the outfits that she dislikes less and find reasons to slowly embrace her creative side and worry less about sharing it.  It's not a big development, and it's been done countless times, but the slight drama that brings it to light and the subtle shift in how the comedy plays off of these developed traits goes a long way in keeping the humor from getting stale and making the moeblobs the show starts with into a fairly convincing group of friends. 
 
Speaking of moeblobs, they come up visually quite often in season 1.  K-On! wasn't the KyoAni goldmine it's known as today until after the anime was airing.  While KyoAni didn't give K-On!'s visuals the same effort as their more serious prior works (such as their Key adaptations) they still put more into it than the standard CGDCT usually receives even now.  On those infrequent occasions the characters actually perform or otherwise take their club seriously, K-On! features some nice animation.  These moments are rather smooth, lively, and feature enough intricate detail for nice touches like the music being played and the animation for the girls playing instruments lining up just about perfectly.  On the other side of the coin, comedy moments often heavily simplify visual details and have much less animation, especially when it comes to the girls and their faces.  At least the framing and background art are always of a high quality to make up for those scenes when they occur. 
 
Fortunately, the sound quality is more consistent than both the animation quality and the Keion-bu's focus on music.  Sure, the performed music is mostly J-pop, but it's noticeably spirited and sounds like the sort of thing a bunch of high-school girls would come up with (save for the ED, which appears much more professional as if to show the club's potential).  The background music is light, simple, and less poppy, but it fits the setting, contrasts the performances well, and is quite varied overall.  However, the voicework (Japanese dub) is where K-On's audio truly shines.  The girls all receive expressive, distinct, wide-ranging voices that fit them like gloves.  It makes them feel so much more alive that K-On simply would not be the same without its voices. 
 
Verdict: 
 
Like most CGDCT anime, K-On!'s 1st season is simple and largely uneventful. All it wants the viewer to do is have some fun, and enough of an effort is put into delivering relatable & organic fun for it to accomplish that consistently. It's that consistency that makes this season a good entry point into CGDCT, because you'll definitely know what it is by the last episode and can easily make a judgment as to whether it's for you or not from there. This season isn't particularly memorable, but for what it is there's little to fault it for, and consistent lighthearted fun has its value.

    Changing ourselves is never easy. Usually it would take one dramatic or traumatic experience to finally give one a slap at the face that they need to change themselves. Let's take one bad habit - drinking for example. It's easy to drown ourselves in cheap beers and vodka and forget our problems for one night but the next day, when soberness kicks in along with the painful hangover, reality kicks you twice as hard. Your problems didn't disappear. You do it again that night and the night after that and again the next day until your kidney throws in the towel. Your problems still haven't been solved and now you gotta think about that kidney operation. Only then will you start to think rationally and face your original problems instead of running away and stop drinking for once. It's when we hit our lowest points, we are the most susceptible to change.  
 
K-On! is a story about change but it doesn't involve any traumatic experience at all. K-On! is a light, fluffy and heart-warming story of five high school girls and their daily lives in the light music club, more specifically - the story of Hirasawa Yui wanting to finally do something meaningful in her life and stray away from her incompetent, lazy, oblivious and irresponsible self. With help from her childhood friend Nodoka, she finds her way to the light music club and they needed a guitarist. Yui then decides to pick one up even with zero knowledge of playing one. Towards the resolution, Yui is a different Yui from the first episode. She becomes more responsible and reliable. Although it took her quite a while but it proves that with the right guidance, change is possible. 
 
Due to the fact that it was based on a 4 panel manga of the same name, the punchline is always spot on. The jokes - albeit more cuter rather than funny, works well for me. While the plot moves very quickly each episode, it manages to highlight each and every one of the individual characters including the side characters, Nodoka, Ui and Sawaka. The animation and art drastically changed in season 2, making the first season look like a lazy excuse to not deliver the same quality though it's not unforgivable because it may be due to limited budget or whatnot. Giving the audio a solid 10 is a no-brainer. I mean, have you heard their songs and BGM? (Fun fact: the voice actors also held concerts where in some of their songs, they play the instruments themselves). Toyosaki Aki, the voice of Hirasawa Yui was a friggin revelation.  
 
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The weakest part of the series is actually the story since it was based on a 4 panel manga and there's only 13 episodes.

    I accidentally stumbled on K-on  while looking for something to watch. At first it seemed to be  a mellow school drama with dramas, pantyshot, and meek boys.But trust me this show is al but those thingsl 
The  art is good, consistent and very  detailed.  in fact  i was hooked up by the wonderful animation. the characters  are far from what i call sexy,  but because there is no panty this is not a problem. 
While the cast seems  to  be sterotypical,   a kind hearthed rich girl,  an uptight smart girl, and a carefree clueless girls. the story  is not about their personel quirks. it's a bout  how a high school girl band tried to earn a recognition. What  ilike the best there is no love story , so it's all about their struggle to make their band big. the music is also very good,  i often stay to hear the ending song 
 
 -But  because this is actually directed at girls,  when the band entered a competition , the supposed  competitors  do what  in real life you call stupidity, they helped  our heroines improve their  music

    K-On! It has to be my all time favorite series. How I found out about it is kinda funny I suppose, but that's a story for another time. 
 
K-On has some really funny moments in it that make up for the lack of a clear story. What got me hooked was the character Mio Akiyama. You might say that I have the most strange love for her, and it's true. The moe-ness of K-ON is almost unbeatable. I challenge anyone to find an anime that is funny, has great music, has lovable characters, and a kickass set of voice actors, both dub and origina Japanese. I cannot get enough of it! Hougako Tea Time for life!

    K-On! was an anime of it's time and it certainly hasn't aged well. If I had watched when if first came out, chances are I would've been all over, but that isn't the case now.  
 
Now it all seems it's just the same thing all over again, cute girls being cute. Oh, guess what, it's different because they play music! I don't really see it as something memorable or anything that would set standards (like other music SOL anime). 
 
But, if you're into that, watch K-On!  
 
Story: 4/10  
 
I forgive it for not having too clear of a plot as it's a slice of life, but I will say as an anime that I went in thinking I wouldn't have to pay too close attention to it, having others telling me that them growing up is the story, which is, quite frankly, boring. I can't say that's even easy for me to say for it's a reach to make in my eyes.  
 
Art: 6/10 
 
I have nothing else to say other than I thought it was cute until I noticed a variety of other anime with the same exact style. Otherwise, there's some issues with the animation and how they shoot scenes.  But the fact this anime came out in 2009 needs to be taken in to account.  
 
Sounds: 5/10 
 
The music is bland and generic. It sounds as if they're trying too hard to be cute or to fit in with the ""anime music"". Even the BGM is generic. But... the voice actors are pretty good, even Yui's (despite the fact I honestly despise Yui's voice because of how high pitched and grating it is, her singing voice is even worse).  
 
Character: 5/10  
 
They are all very, very stereotypical and fit into a sub type somehow. All of the characters can be seen as unbearable and obnoxious if someone can't stand moe girls.  
 
The only thing I really appreciated was the subtle character development, my favorite being Mio as it appeared to be the most realistic and something I could relate to. 
 
Enjoyment: 6/10 
 
I enjoyed it while I watched it and nothing more. I wouldn't want to rewatch it because then I would start nitpicking it more than I already have. It's something to turn off your mind to and that wasn't the easiest for me to do. K-On! isn't my cup of tea, but I can certainly see how it can be someone's favorite.   
 
Overall: 5/10  
  
Mediocre. K-On! just isn't supposed to be seen as something deep or meaningful, it's something fun and cute other people can enjoy. If you're expecting something unique and different... Well...

    This is the type of Anime that you watch just because of how cute it is, and let me tell you, it's very cute. 
 
The story is about a high school girl named 'Yui', who at first doesn't know anything about music, or guitars. She joins the Light Music Club in hopes of maybe finding something she can outlet to, and make some friends with; and it works out great! 
 
Art and Sound are amazingly well done! It's not too over the top, but it's just right. And the OP is highly addictive! 
 
Characters at first were a bit bland to me. But, as usual, I've grown to love them and their unique quirks that they offer through the show. The characters are really a highlight here. 
  
Lastly, this anime may be a bit boring at first. But I assure you that it's well worth the watch! The characters are definitely memorable, and the OP is super addicting! I will be watching this one again. 
 
Also, me, being someone who makes music and knows quite a bit about music theory, found this Anime to be very interesting to watch. And I'm not going to lie, but I learned a few things I had no idea about!

    I've never been a fan of this oddly specific genre of anime where a band (no pun intended) of school girls do absolutely nothing because there's no real story, so obviously this show isn't for me. But what I hoped for was that the implementation of music to the show would help it discern from every other one of these types of anime. Unfortunately, I had no such luck. Despite this show being about musicians, the soundtrack is mediocre and the characters rarely play their own instruments. The animation was very bright and pretty, there was no story, the sound was servicable, the characters were KAWAII DESU, and I didn't really like it at all. I mean try it out by all means.

    THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 
 
Non-spoiler version: 
Story: 1; it was very predictable and didn't have any interesting themes. They barely did what we were promised that we were going to see. 
Art: 8; This was actually very good. It was cute, had a nice style and the animation was good. 
Music: 7; This was good too. The OP and the songs that the band performed were very good. But the background music and the ED wasn't very good (it didn't really have the same style as the rest of the music) 
Characters: 2: The characters were even more predictable and one-sided. 
Enjoyment: 3; the predictable and one-sided story and characters made it less enjoyable, but it was extremely cute.  
 
Overall: 3 
 
 
 
Spoiler review: 
 
Story: It was very predictable and forgettable. They didn't do anything interesting, they barely played in the group. Did they expect me to believe that Yui learned to play guitar after like 2 times of playing? They just drink tea and eat cookies for the majority of the time. And the 13th episode was very weird. It felt like they wanted to change it into a drama at the end of the first season, and then changed their mind in the last 5 minutes of the episode. 
 
Art: OK, this was actually very good. It was cute, the style was nice and the animation was smooth. 
 
Music: I really liked the OP and the music that the Band performs. But the background music was very forgettable. And then we have the ED which was extremely out-of-place 
 
Characters:  
Let's see what characters we had. 
 
Yui: extremely one-sided and had no character development. She begins as a child in a 15-year-olds body and ends up as a child in a 15-year-olds body. She didn't show any other characteristics other than being happy and childish. 
 
Mio: She was the only one that wasn't as one-sided as the other ones, but she was definitely the most predictable one. She was always scared of something that Ritsu showed and then she would punch Ritsu which was apparently supposed to be funny. It was never funny. But I have to say that she is a shy and introverted character that doesn't go over-the-top, which is good.  
 
Tsumugi: She didn't really have a character. She was happy and was rich. She was basically there to be rich. I don't really have anything else to say 
 
Azusa: She was basically a combination of Tsumugi and Mio.  
 
Ritsu: She was just annoying 
 
Yamanaka: I liked her in the beginning. She was nice. And then they mention her also performing music back in the day and it was like it triggered something in her. After that, she becomes creepy, perverted, annoying and in general not nice. She had a line where she said that she could know the difference between Mio and Azusa by feeling their breast size. Think about that for a second. Their teacher just tried to sexually harass them. THEIR TEACHER TRIED TO GRAB THEIR BREAST! 
 
Enjoyment: 3; The characters and the story made me furious. But it was extremely cute 
 
Overall 3

    This anime is an absolute masterpiece. The characters go through a wide range of emotions and continue to grow, even in the last episodes. The dynamics and the attitudes of both the girls' interactions and the music that they play is truly a testament to the writers' abilities. The art style gives the characters life and perfectly display their emotions, while giving the background a depth that is often neglected. 
This anime combines the slice of life genre so perfectly with a musical setting, that sometimes during the musical segments you forget that this is an anime about high school girls. The music is legitimately good and will be stuck in your head for days if not weeks after watching. 
The dialogue is cute, as is typical of CGDCT anime but has a lot of interplay between characters. The yuri undertones are unsettling at times, as the age difference between some of the characters can be drastic, but it never ventures too far into fan service territory and is often used to enhance the plot of the episode or the series as a whole 
 I deeply enjoyed this anime and it is clearly a benchmark that all CGDCT anime aspires to meet.

    Story (10/10) 
The story looks so simple at the beginning that you simply say ""Meh, It'll only be another slice of life anime"" ... BUT NO!!! ... It's totally original and cool :3 
 
Art (7/10) 
Well ... I'm just no good on giving art reviews ... so I'll just give it an average punctuation u_u 
 
Sound (9/10) 
Well, since this is a kind of musical anime obviously the sound is a total masterpiece ... It's really good, plus all the songs are REALLY catchy 
 
Characters (9/10) 
Well, I can't say ""Whoa the characters are really original"" or anything like that, but somehow they managed to make the cliched characters to act and look really good and so different as the other characters you've seen up to now. 
 
Enjoyment (10/10) 
You'll definitely enjoy it. You wanna laugh? ... You'll laugh a lot. You want moe moments? You'll have TONS ... I really recommend it to anyone and every episode surprises you somehow ... expected the unexpected. 
 
Overall (8/10) 
Well I can't tell you ""OMG It's a masterpiece"" since I just don't kinda like the idea of the story. I won't lie, I just love how they make the simple storyline into something funny and really enjoyable. But I just can't make it 10/10 ... Sorry :3 
 
Well ... to summarize: It's a really worth to watch anime. I really recommend it. You won't get bored nor disappointed when you watch it :3

    actually feel reviewing this anime is not so important because all animelovers should also know at this animation anime claim kyoto but suppose just recalled. nih anime was the first to ""mislead"" I got to the otaku world, from here I know that apparently anime selalunya not only discuss the theme superpower like Naruto, One Piece, Bleach and other anime super power. until now, is a slice of life including my favorite genre. k-on lifting school genre - music remains attractive even in rewatch. tells the storyof everyday life in high school sakuragaoka 5 friends who are in the same club. That club music, club music even though his name but they spend moretime to have fun, eat and drink tea but when they want to hold a concert. They are always serious and intense. I like most of this anime. Is the cuteness of thecharacters who always makes me laugh.

    One of the Moest moe anime of the early 2010s. I recently watched it and i had not watched any moe anime before.Glad i came across K-On.There wasn't a single episode in which i didn't try to sing along in what brokenish japanese i know during every single opening of Cagayake girls.[i dare you not to smile during the opening] Almost everything from the way Yui conducts herself to how she names inanimate objects to how goofy she is shoots off a Kawaii wave which'll make even the grumpiest grumpton smile.Kind of short compared to the second season but still covered a lot of story from the manga. But really a uber cool show :)

         What can you say about a show that seemed to be really popular at the time of release, but in reality only works cause the characters can sell well. 
     From the get go the Art  felt incredibly sloppy. The 1st couple episodes where the studio should really be putting a lot of time and money into making it look as pristine as possible felt rushed. 
     The sound track was a let down as well the Background noise and music wasn't bad. But for a Anime centered more or less around music (Despite what Yui thinks) I was quite disappointed. I would probably listen to almost any other anime's music track before i go to this one. 
     The Characters did grow on me despite my best efforts to hate the seemingly endless Cliches.  
     The biggest problem that i had with K-on was the pacing, Time skips are abound and you will have your head spinning from the 1st episode. I won't go into much detail, but be forewarned.

    As always i don't go too deep into details as it seems like a pain for both the one who writes (me) and for those who reads (you) so lets keep it short and sweet. 
 
note: this review is done on behalf of both seasons. you can say that i'm lazy but i find it as a way of conserving energy, got 6 more reviews 
 
In this anime we are first greeted to Yui, a clumsy and sweet girl with a juvenile sense of behaviour (like any other moe character, right?) then comes Mio , Ritsu and Mugi who are desperately trying to keep they're little Grunge band together. Yui, being the sugar-loving idiot she is decides to join the band with no knowledge about the guitar with the false presumption that light music meant clapping a few castanets. *sigh,,oh Yui...but things eventually pan out for them.  
 
that's all for the story i'll be stating. If you are interested in watching the anime please do pay attention to the inconspicuous moments that seperate this from any normal moe anime 
 
As for the moral, it's to do something you love with the people you love. 
Life is short and it isn't meant to be used to do something you dislike or find monotonous. It's to enjoy every second of it with the people that makes everyday special for you. You don't have to be the best at something, just make sure you're enjoying it. 
 
that's all i'll be saying about the anime. It really does speak for itself once you watch it. this is where i log off , Adios....nah wait we're talkin' about anime..JAPANESE! JA MATTA! (see ya)

    What makes this anime interesting is their story as high school students, the cuteness of characters and the most important- the music. I like this anime because as a fellow musician, I can relate on what they are doing such as being able to play an instrument, working hard for practice until you can reach success. Just two words: Keion Rocks!!

    I only started watching K-On! when a friend of mine mentioned it on one of my display pictures. I never regretted my decision afterwards. In fact, I got so addicted to it I basically zoomed through the whole thing in like 2 months. And I'm only talking about .... 2 years ago maybe?   
 
Story: K-On! doesn't really focus on a good guy and a bad guy fighting and explosions or zombies etc. K-On basically focuses on the main characters or in other words the MAIN main character Yui and the light music club. It's mostly about her care-free life and if you're into moe or cute stuff, you might find this enjoyable. 
 
Art: Awesome!!!!! Enough said.  
 
 
Sound: This is the main reason I like K-On! so much. Their music is superb! I like every OPs and EDs of K-On because they combine the music and the artwork together and it looks extremely PRO.  
 
Characters: I like all characters of K-On! They all look so cute!  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10  
 
So if you like the things I'm mentioned above, then K-On!, K-On!! or K-On movie just might be right for you.

    K-On! is by no means an anime for everybody. One can not go into K-On! expecting an intricate story, or deep character development. It is a slice-of-life anime without a season or series long plot, in fact, almost every episode has a different plot (Although, some of them are very similar).  
 
K-On! is very cute. That is probably the first thing everyone will notice about it, and many will be put off by this fact, however after watching a few episodes, I couldn't help but laugh at the silly, childish, and cute humor this series is filled with. 
Some of the humor is recycled (Mostly in this season), and after a while, it will lose its value, but they managed to keep me laughing at least once an episode all the way through.  
 
For most of the series, there is no deep character development. By this, I mean that what you see in the first few episodes, is what you get.  
Yui is hyper, and childish, but cute in her own right. 
Tsumugi is generally quiet, and appears graceful, but often proves to be just as childish as Yui. 
Mio is the most mature of the initial four main characters, but her own shadow would scare her to the point of defecation (Which you'd better get used to, as it is probably the most recycled joke in the first season).  
and finally, Ritsu, who is much like Yui, except much less memorable. She also plays the drums. Ritsu is generally the least liked of the main cast, because there's really nothing unique about her aside from her tomboy-ish style.  
 
 
K-On! is well worth watching, and I would recommend everyone to continue to K-On!!(S2)  even if you didn't like the first season. K-On!! fixes many of the problems that existed in the first season. 
 
In conclusion, K-On! is one of my favorite series of all time (Anime or otherwise), and near the end of the series, it pulled my heartstrings in a way I never thought an animated show could.  
 
If you haven't watched K-On!, do it. Now. Why are you still reading this?

    ""Fun things are fun!"" 
--Yui Hirasawa 
 
((Reviewer's Note: This is a review that only discusses the first season of K-On! There are mild to moderate spoilers below the fold, you have been warned.)) 
 
K-On! is a show that everyone, whether they have seen it or not, is very quick to form an opinion on. It was perhaps the culmination of the ""moe"" trend in anime, pioneered specifically by the creative minds at Kyoto Animation, into practically the formation of its own genre in 2009. KyoAni was riding high on the success of Haruhi Suzumiya's first season in the late 2000s, and specifically the most iconic scene in the series, the epic rock concert at the end of episode 12. So why not adapt a four-panel manga series about a bunch of cute girls learning to play in a rock band? And thus, K-On! the anime was born, and the rest is history. 
 
Where K-On really excels as a show is in the very close attention to detail that comes out in every frame. The characters are drawn cutely but with a dose of realism. Their body types are rather normal for a high-school girl. Their uniforms are regulation-length. The fanservice is kept to a minimum, and what is there makes sense within the events of the storyline. 
 
Characterization can make or break slice-of-life shows. Characters you want to see on screen can overcome a lack of any driving plot structure. K-On manages to make its characters engaging, lovable, and always fun to watch. You could put these five girls in just about any situation and the results would be something worth your time. The characters also evolve and change, none more than the presumptive main heroine, Yui Hirasawa.  
 
Yui starts off the show as someone who might be charitably called ""attention-deficient"" and might uncharitably be called ""an idiot"". Over time, as she joins the Light Music Club and gets closer to the rest of the girls passing their time in the small, somewhat cramped club room, a change begins to take place over her, and it happens so carefully and with such subtlety that by the time you notice it you'll be done with the first season. 
 
The other girls all complement each other in a variety of different ways, and scenes play out very differently depending on who is there. Tsumugi Kotobuki is a wealthy girl with a heart of absolute gold. Mio Akiyama is a big scaredy-cat and doesn't enjoy being in the limelight no matter how often the girls press her to embrace her role as the face of the band. Ritsu Tainaka is a troublemaker and riffs off the other girls effortlessly, and her comedic portions are perhaps tied with Yui's coming-of-age as the best part of this first season. Very late in the season we are introduced to Azusa Nakano, a kouhai to the other girls who joins the Light Music Club. Unfortunately, she doesn't get much characterization in the five short episodes she's in. She actually comes across as incredibly redundant since her attitude is a little too similar to Mio and her instrument of choice is the same as Yui's.  
 
The flaws with Azusa's introduction didn't detract much from the characterization of the group as a whole. They all get closer. They all learn from each other. They're all great friends, and one of the big themes of K-On is that your friends can make you something better than you are by yourself. A lot of people like to rag on the show for being ""not about music"" but it was never about four girls playing music. It was always about four girls growing closer with music as the excuse for them to hang out after school. The music is the backdrop, not the main attraction. 
 
That said, the few songs that are in the show are a great treat. Light, poppy, fun little ditties that absolutely will get stuck in your head long after you've finished watching. The OP and ED are both fantastic visually and aurally, with ""Don't Say Lazy"" probably being one of the most iconic EDs of the past decade. The background music is solid, and the sound direction is on-point, with great use of silence to focus the viewer's attention during the serious parts of the show. 
 
K-On is far from perfect, however, as the 7 atop this review will attest. The actual plot of the show, as much as there is one, is really stock and won't take anyone by surprise. There is the unfortunate fact that two out of the 13 episodes of the show take place at the beach, and the second one feels like a rehash of the first. As mentioned above, Azusa is introduced so late into the season that it's hard to grow attached to her as much as the original four, and her attitude comes across as needlessly tsundere in a show where it just feels out of place. The art is consistent and solid, but doesn't really go out of its way to strive for any real great effects outside of the great attention to detail. It's just not to the standard I've come to expect from KyoAni, even for its age.  
 
Overall, K-On's first season is a fun ride, a solid, strong introduction to some great characters becoming something greater than they were at the start through the power of music, snacks, and love. I enjoyed it, and little did I know that the best was very much yet to come. 
 
But that is a story for another time. Until next time, may the cute things in your life always have cute girls to do them.

    K-on is one of the Anime that i give 10/10 to. Why? Because it does what for me is the most important thing any drama, TV show, movie, manga, anime, novel can do and that is capture the beauty of life and living and encourage those watching to live more.  Then there is the music (which is awesome, thanks Itunes for carrying K-on songs), the characters who are all so real, so full of life, each is so full of what makes them them, the animation which is well done, the voice acting which is great. It all comes together to create something wonderful. Thank-you to all those who had s hand in creating K-on, Awesome work!!!!!

    K-On to me is an odd show, an odd show that stands out to me.    
 
Story (5) - Well, this anime doesn't really have one? It gets side tracked a lot that there is only a clear story for the first few episodes.   
 
Art (9) - I love looking at the environment and the art style this show brings us, I can tell all the characters apart and the backgrounds look clear as day. Same animation can be a bit still and awkward though. 
 
Sound (10) - I watched the dub and the voice actresses did an amazing job. The music in the show is actually pretty good, the opening and the ending are highlights for  songs you listen to for every episode.    
 
Character (9) - i love seeing these characters interact with people around them, they all are so awkward but loveable at the same time. The main characters work well together and  each have there own personalities so they don't feel bland and the same.   
 
Enjoyment (10) 
 
Overall (10) - Even with the all over the place story, I love thiis anime, I normally wouldn't like something with an odd story but with characters so likeable it's so hard to argue.

    Funny - Cute - Plotless 
 
If these words are ones that don't leave any negative thoughts in your head, you'll probably enjoy K-On! quite a bit. It's a harmless show that has no real themes, morals, or plot of any kind. It's just a show that is all about having fun. Plain and simple. 
 
Despite what you may think beforehand, the truth of the matter is that there is no plot. Yes, certain episodes have some small roadblock for certain characters, but really, there's mainly nothing going on plot-wise in this anime. I don't necessarily have a problem with that. Lucky Star has no plot, and yet, it is one of my favorite anime of all time. It works due to the humor and characters. When it comes to K-On!, the humor is pretty good for the most part. It definitely had me laughing at certain parts that were silly and stupid, but in a cute way. None of the humor deals with fanservice or adult jokes of any kind. It's very safe. Some people may not like that, but I greatly enjoyed every minute. One thing to keep in mind is that this isn't an anime where we get band songs every episode. There's probably three times where we see the characters play together. Just something to keep in mind. 
 
It's no surprise to anyone that the animation and character designs are beautifully crafted. It's a show that looks as amazing as one would assume from KyoAni.  
 
Music here is definitely above average. I wouldn't cal it groundbreaking or anything. The songs played by the characters in the anime are all rock. They're well composed and everything, but not very memorable. Same with the OP and ED. Good, but slowly drifts away from the mind after watching an episode.  
 
The characters in K-On! are quite enjoyable too. They all have the traits you would assume from this type of anime. None really grow or transform that much throughout the series. Yui provides most of the comedy in the series. She's great. Her humor always hits a good note (no pun intended). One of my favorite jokes in the series deals with her and a guitar. I won't spoil it for you, but you'll know it when it happens. It's comedy gold.  
 
Did I enjoy K-On!? Yeah, but it never went over the hill for me. Sure, the humor works, but it isn't as strong as other slice of life anime. The characters were all enjoyable to watch, especially Yui. There weren't any characters I disliked or found annoying. With that said, they weren't anything to write home about ether. At the end of the day, this is a very good anime that will entertain you while watching it. With that said, it's not life-changing. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see it, but if you have nothing better to watch, it's a fun way to waste time and have some great laughs. Don't expect anything deep though.

    (I thought I had written on of these before, but oh well) 
K-on! became one of my all time favorites.  It is slice of life that I like, and music, which I love. The character were relatable.  They had depth to them and could see them walking down the street of any small town.  The art was great.  I love Kyoto Animation's work.  They made realistic characters with pastel colors to soften them up and make them a little cartoony.  The story, was surprising strong.  I was afraid that it was going to be a time saver for another series, but it had a good, deep story behind it.  The sound was great.  I think I mentioned in some of my other reviews that I like music, even if I don't understand the language it's written in.  K-on! has some good music.  All in all I enjoyed the show and glad I took a gamble on it.

    This Animie should not enchant me as it does; the story is mostly non existent, the music is too few and far between (although brilliant when it is being played) and most of all it is largely inane and somewhat pointless.  
 
However, despite these flaws, the characters bring out a strange side of me where I'm enthralled by even the most inane of their actions, they have created characters where development is not needed as they are already so freaking cute, I can't but love every second of the show.   
 
Watching the idealistic lives of several girls who don't have to deal with any problems that would usually turn me off slice of life shows (Usually boys .... my god that bores me senseless), I feel about as relaxed as I can be, their inane chatter is soothing, their problems solvable yet the great voice acting and character design (English version dub) makes me empathize with them to a point where i start to care about their inane problems.  
 
To summarize, i would recommend anyone to watch this show, I doubt everyone will like it,  but if you are not turned off of it by episode 4 then I would bet you will have a new top Animie.  
 
Inane but irresistible

    I was very hesitant in starting this anime for some reason, but now that I've finished it I regret not starting it any sooner. This has become one of my favorite anime's because it is so awfully cute and the characters really get to you. The plot isn't a complicated one, and the characters themselves are what bring the most out of the anime. We have an airhead, a shy girl, a somewhat tomboy, a rich character who doesn't know a lot of commoner things, a little sister with a sister complex, and a younger club member who kinda looks like a cat.  The way the show is carried out and the interactions between the characters is one of the best things about the show. The music the characters sing is cute and fluffy and most of the ending songs are actually really nice. Overall, I highly recommend this anime, it's so cute and you grow attached to the characters, and their music

    K-on is part of the ""Moe"" Genre that is apparently booming out of Japan now.  If you want to see Moe Girls play the guitar  then this is a perfect show for you. if you want your show to have just cute girls and little plot then this is the for you also because just from watching this show it has very little to no plot. You got you stereotypical charters, the airhead, the rich girl, the tsundere, the smart one,  and the hyper one mix them with music and give them with instruments and that's all this show is with that added ""Moe"" spice.   Props because the songs in the show are pretty good as well as the art work.(btw if you seen Black rock shooter the art work for that show is pretty much the same)  but what was lacking was a real plot. Girl join club, club makes band, band practice, band preforms at school festival  and this goes for the whole show. It was good but not that great of a anime.

    Okay, K-On! is hands down one of the best slice-of-life anime I've ever seen. Firstly I'm going to give a brief summary on what this anime entails. Secondly, I'm going to say why you should watch this anime! 
 
This anime revolves around Yui Hirasawa and her high school friends. She has just started high school and has no idea which club she wants to join. She finally meets Ritsu and Mio, who coerse her into joining the group even though she has no idea how to play any instruments. We then follow her journey on becoming an aspiring guitar player and laughing along with her and her friends silly 
 
This anime surprised me as how it could suck in the viewers to instinctively love all of the characters. There aren't many slice-of-life anime that I have been so attracted to. I really liked how viewers can learn a little something about music while laughing at Yui and her friends goofing around. It is not very different from other slice-of-life anime, except for the music core and atmosphere. I cannot stress how much the atmosphere of this anime just got me so excited to watch episode after episode.  
 
If you're into music oriented anime, and just loving a genuine fun show, where you can connect with the characters, this is the anime for you!

    I just watched all the K-ON! episodes 
I really like watching music anime so out of boredom i watched it 
It was so-so for me. I usually don't like cute girly animes, 
but it kept me interested enough to finish watching the series

    2 years after my leave from my anime community, K-ON has somehow wiggled it's way into my daily life yet again. Now,  I at least have some wisdom to write a formal review (unlike 2 years ago *shudder*). 
 
K-ON! is a moeblob anime targeted for the shojo audience, but does have some seinen elements like its manga counterpart. Being in the shojo demographic myself, I found it very appealing, enojoyable, and somewhat relatable. The art is good, being managed by KyoAni, with a proper amount of chibi scenes and vivid animeaation during EDs/OPs (great detail in individual playing). However, during the start of the anime, there is some asymmetry and choppy frames. The sound is great as well, songs made to fit with the feel of the anime. The lyrics can get a little too fluffy/meaningless. Songs from the soundtrack really make up for that, though. The character development is pretty good in most areas, except for Yui and Mugi. There is great chemistry between Mio and Ritsu, and some other underlying yuri tones help bring other good chemistry out from the other characters (totally not biased because of my love of yuri). But Yui and Mugi I feel don't go through as much change as the others. Yui is always ditsy with her occasional sense of ""this is what I was meant to do"" and ""this group is my destiny"" in key areas, but I feel her personality is too moe and cliche. Mugi has barely any background and sometimes I feel like she's there just to provide the club deus-ex-machina-esque moments. Besides that, she only has the small lines which barely make an impact on the overall story. 
But, the enjoyment (for my age at least) is a 10. I really felt like the everyday adventures of the club were easy to watch for me, relaxing. However, don't expect Evangelion, because you aren't going to get many poetic moments or major gravity in the show, as that's not what it's about. 
The story is, as I said before, great for shojo and/or slow-going slice of life lovers, but can appeal to grown men if they like moeblob. 
Overall, it's an 9 from me, regardless of how much I love this show (I really love this show).

    Quite frankly i can sum this anime up in two words. Tea Party.  
 
The concept of tea is supposed to generate a feeling of relaxation or something that's laid back. This anime accomplishes this in a refreshing way but does not really astound appealing more to the niche moe genre than trying to actually do anything with the material they have.  
 
The characters are nice and cute and the art is nice and cute..... hell i think this entire show is based around nice and cute. It's an enjoyable watch but don't expect too much story. This anime is ultimately about the characters and whether or not you like this anime hinges on whether or not you like the characters. Most of the archetypes are there so this shouldn't be anything too painful to watch, just expect less music than they would lead you to believe.

    The first time I watched this series, I dropped in the middle of the first episode, because I couldn't stand Yui's character. But months later when I gave it another shot, I loved K-On, it is now even one of my favorite anime. I no longer found Yui irritating, but rather so cute. I would never know why. 
 
Story (9) 
The story is very simple. It's hard to say that there is a main plot, actually. Well it's to be expected, I guess, since it's a Slice of Life genre. But each episode has a quite good story, so it didn't bother me too much. I know that there are people who prefer an anime with a solid main plot, but it isn't bad to have this kind time to time.  
 
Art (10) 
One of the biggest asset of this series. The art is amazingly done, the characters are drawn ever so cutely and the animation's terrific too. 
 
Sound (10) 
Another biggest asset. Openings, endings, BGMs, insert songs, everything was fantastic. The main character's voice (who sings pretty much all the songs) could be annoying to some; I even so people complaining why Mio isn't the one singing. But you're forgetting something here. This series features moe stuff. In my opinion, Yui's voice is THE moe voice. I don't know how to explain this, you just have to hear her voice, I guess. 
And the seiyuus have done a terrific job, too. 
 
Character (9) 
I could say that the characters are quite the sterotypes- the air-headed one, the popular one, the boyish one, the rich one, and the youngest one. And the characters are very shallow, by which I mean that we don't really know anything of their past, etc. Alas, it doesn't stop us to squeal over this girls. You don't feel any of this while watching the series. 
 
Enjoyment (10)  
 
Overall (10) 
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

    Just Finished K-On!! (Both seasons and will most likely have this same review for the 2nd Season Review page, just because they're the same Anime.) 
 
My expectations for it may have been high, But I will say, It didn't disappoint. 
It was great all around, It had its Happy Moments, Its (somewhat) serious moments, but most of it was all fun.  The music was Great(and incredibly Addicting).  Especially their one song that you hear most of the time; 
""Fuwa Fuwa Time"" 
 
As for Story, the Story was kind of Hard to Follow, But in a Good Way.  Thats whats to fun about this one.  If your Looking for Deep story in a Musical Anime, look for Tari Tari or something like that.  This one is Just for Fun, and Enjoyment. 
 
The Art was ""old-fashioned"" in a good way as well.  Compared to all the new anime, where its like, I cant quite explain it, but the Art in this one was Great for the type of anime it was.  Each type of thing symbolised what each character had.  With Kotobuki's Enormus Eyebrows symbolizing that she was the daughter of the guy that owned that music store, or that the Hair Style Between Ui and Yui symbolised who was more childish and who was the more serious one. 
 
The sound in terms of the Music was FANTASTIC!  The songs were really catchy, and the names were really cheery and happy.  it made me smile every time their songs were playing, and it made me want to hear the whole thing(because they always seemed to cut off) 
 
The Characters were...  Odd, but thats whats refreshing about this anime.  Its different from the rest, and I really liked that about this one.  With Yui's Child-like Attitude, or Meo's Seriousness, It made it fun whenever they were all talking about something, and then something would happen, and someone would do something funny then they'd all laugh. 
 
Enjoyment?  Heh.  HELLZ YEAH I ENJOYED IT!!!  It was Catchy, Fun, and Incredibly Addicting to sing Fuwa Fuwa Time everytime they would sing it.  When they would sing their songs during the Cultural Festivals, I would Clap with the song.  It was an anime that had me sucked in to the very end.(Season 2 as well) 
 
Overall, It was Great, and Different and I really Liked it. 
 
The Name of the band was ""After-school Tea Time(Hōkago tītaimu)"" or HTT for Short. 
The way they had the characters set up was, kinda weird, but I liked it. It was different from you usual Song Type anime.  It was always bringing something fun to each episode and I was looking forward to the next episode after I would finish the last. 
 
Highly Recommend it to Anyone looking to have a great time.

    This is my first review, please don't expect too much. Also, it may say that I haven't seen all the episodes. That is because I rewatch this show from time to time. 
 
Keion, better known as “K-On!” is a Slice-of-Life anime based on five adorable girls and their efforts in “The Light Music Club.” K-On was a show I watched based off of the recommendations section I saw for the anime “Kokoro Connect.” And boy was I glad that I did. Before I begin I would like to warn you that K-On is a show about “cute girls doing cute things.” If you aren’t really into that kind of stuff I would go look for a different show. Now, let’s get started. 
 
The Characters: 
The first episode of “K-on!” introduces us to the first four main characters. The great thing about this show is that they all have their own original personality and none of the girls really give off the same type of vibe. You have Ritsu, the drummer. Ritsu is the wild one of the group. She attempts to get the group to go along with her silly ideas and usually goes all out against the ideas she doesn’t like. Ritsu is very lively and is able to keep the show a lot more interesting. Then there is her childhood friend, Mio, the Bass player and sometimes singer. Mio is the shy one, and having Ritsu as her best friend, it creates some interesting situations. Sometimes she gets really embarrassed and it she becomes very lovable to watch. Ritsu helps push her through her fears, giving us a fun dynamic duo to watch. Next is Yui, the lead guitarist and singer.  She is really the key character of this show, because it’s mostly about her life. Yui is a really lazy airhead who is on the verge of being a “NEET.” She enters the light music club thinking that it was something completely different. Watching her grow as a guitarist is enjoyable to watch, and proves for great character development. Finally is Mugi the pianist, whom personally is my favorite character is the silly rich girl. She doesn’t really know about more common things such as fast food joints and arcades, and it puts up for some great comedy. It was funny to watch her learn about all the things that we “middle-class” have to put up with and what we do for fun. Finally, is the rhythm guitarist Azusa.   She isn’t introduced to later after the first four go through their freshmen year. She is one year younger than the other four, and is the same age as Yui’s sister Ui. She is the girl who tries to get the club to actually practice music and not laze around the whole time. Her go-getter attitude is what makes her cute and fun to watch. All of the side characters are quite the cool bunch as well. They all provide more humor and play well with the main characters. 
 
The Story: 
	As I said earlier this show is about “The Light Music Club” or Keion Club (K-On! The title is a play-off of this.) At first there are zero members in the club and it is about to be disbanded. But Ritsu while forcing Mio, begin to bring the club back to life attempting to get the required four members.  Eventually Mugi, looking for the choir club, and Yui, who is looking for something easy end up joining the duo meeting this requirement. The Light Music Club’s main focus IS SUPPOSE to be playing “Light-hearted” music as their advisor Sawako calls it; but they actually don’t really do much but drink tea and eat snacks. Well you may now be wondering, “How can a show like this be any good at all?” Well the main reason behind it is because it is just really funny and the jokes that end up being made within the show are so great and memorable. There are also the bonds between the characters. The main ones of Mio and Ritsu and Yui and Azusa are just so cute to watch. The way they end up working together to get their problems solved, such as finding a way to get Yui her first guitar, to the camaraderie between the friends, puts such a fine feeling within you, causing you to beg for more. With the hardships of getting through school and practicing music, this show gives me some of the most fun I have ever had. 
 
Music: 
	Do you like J-Pop? If you do you will surely love the music presented by The Light Music Club’s band known as “After School Tea Time.” They actually members of the Japanese cast sing all of the songs that the band in the show sings. The music is crisp and soothing and is a joy to listen to. I actually have put many of the songs on CDs to listen to in my car. There is also the background music. It’s very cheerful and playful but none of it is really too ground breaking like “Ring Ring Ring!” from the show “Little Busters!” While the background music is really nothing too memorable, the OPs, EDs, and insert songs keep you coming back for more. 
 
Art: 
	The art to this show is absolutely phenomenal. Of course, this is nothing unexpected of Kyoto Animation, who have produced masterpieces such as Kanon, and Lucky Star. The art is all fluid and clear, very pleasing to the eyes. I personally enjoyed how they do a few of the performance scenes, as they use well worked camera angles to show the audience, and the emotion of the band themselves. As usual I would say that Kyoto Animation hit another homerun art wise. 
 
Final Remarks: 
I waited until now to reveal that “K-On!”  is my favorite show, or at least one of them. The only show that stands with it would be the original Pokemon (Kanto and Johto series.) I have purchased all episodes as well as the movie and even have most of the songs from the show on my Nook (Yes I use a Nook for music). K-On has been my favorite show even after watching about 80 more series. With that K-On does receive a 10/10. Thanks for reading and I hope you check it out.

    K-On! is one of the most known anime to be honets, the art-style is really moe and the characters are super lovable. The music in it is freaking amazing, I watched this anime years ago but I still listening to songs like ""Don't Say Lazy"" almost every day. The comedy in it is really good for a slice of life and they kept it going perfectly in both seasons and in the movie making it a really good slice of life to re-watch. The plot development (in the whole band thingy) isn't that great... I mean, they barely try. Anyways, K-on is a slice of life after all and Is not all about music like, say, Love Live, so plot matters don't really matter that much. 
If you're into moe-stuff, good slices of life and awesome j-rock music, you should really check this anime out. I'm still waiting for the anime adaptation of K-On College tho.

    The strange and (in my opinion) great thing about K-on is that it is pointlessly entertaining. 
 
The story is pretty cliche yes, and it never strays from the guidelines of slice-of-life, but the way I see it, K-on specialises (and does a damn good job) in delivering straightforward, lighthearted fun. I really loved that there was no drama or romance (as it can make you dislike characters) and that the main character is never treated as the underdog; it was without the frustration (if done badly)of watching characters overcome social rejection.The characters are easy-going and lovable, and they actually drive the fun and aren't boring like most female slice-of-life characters. You can't help feeling carefree when both story and characters treat life like one long tea party! 
 
I personally love this anime so I'm nitpicking, but there's no real sense of accomplishment by the end of this anime. Whether it's because of the lack of training montages or because the songs are a bit rubbish, you don't really care too much about the fact that they're in a band. However, you can't be a band without being friends, and that friendship comes across strongly in K-on. 
 
It always boggles my mind when I scroll through the completely K-on free top 100 on the anime list; people are so critical! Sometimes you don't want to engage in anime. All the long exposition and the static dialogue scenes and the slow development can feel like a chore. Sometimes you need to leave it to K-on, and turn off!

    K-on is an anime about a band. Although it could be an anime about how to constantly giggle or eat cake and drink tea. Seriously though if you are looking for a serious anime about music look somewhere else. This anime does not have much music in the episodes at all. The other downside to watching this is that it doesn't have much of a plot. Instead it mainly focuses on the daily lives of the Light Music Club (the main characters). 
While I have been bashing this show in the first half of this review I admittingly found it to be entertaining. While the music in the main show itself is generally not that exciting, the music during the opening and ending is phenomenal and easily catches your attention. If you like J-pop then you will definitely like this anime. The few concerts scenes they show are very good with the music and instruments syncing together. This is where the animation really shines and is at its best during the concerts and opening and ending scenes. The characters themselves are nothing special and are not very memorable. Overall, while it isn't the greatest anime I've ever seen, it is my favorite to watch if I'm sitting around the house or doing my homework.

    K-on! presents itself to the average viewer as another ordinary high-school, slice-of-life form of anime with nothing to appealing about it aside from the interesting enough exclamation mark in the title. Upon further investigation I came upon an anime that was indeed that but with a musical twist to it which is applied albeit in a minimal fashion. 
 
The story itself is weak, with no easily identifiable goals or ending point and rather simply follows the 4 main characters around on their yearly adventures as your typical high-school girl clique. If anything the only identifiable form of anchoring that holds the plot together is the presence of music. The story does however, serve its purpose as a light anime to watch whenever you so choose as its lack of plot makes it fairly easy to pick up at any point. 
 
The character development is fair, nothing to spectacular but nothing left to be desired. The strength in what the series has done however, is build an attachment to the characters by their antics. However, once again, it's your typical group of 4 with nothing too spectacular in terms of breaking the mold. 
 
The main form of enjoyment to be found in this anime was rather the antics  
presented and the constant sources of your atypical slap stick humor.  
 
Overall, I found it to be an enjoyable experience to watch but difficult to watch for long periods of time due to the semi-monotonous tone it gave off after watching 15 or so episodes in a row.

    More or less directly copied from my review on Anime Planet. 
 
----------------------------- 
 
This is my first review, so bear with me. 
 
After finishing Kokoro Connect and its OVA ""sequel"" Michi Random, I was left with something of a void. Not to the extent of Steins;Gate or Clannad: After Story, but there was a hole in my anime schedule that I thought would be difficult to fill. 
Some people say that if you're stuck on what to watch after finishing a show, then start a show similar to the one that left the void. With this in mind, I decided to watch K-On!. Why? Because the character designs in Kokoro made me think of this show; most likely because the same character designer worked on both shows. 
 
 
Story 
 
As much as the story centres around music, it is still very much a slice of life anime, and as such, there are many times where the characters, rather than practicing, just sit around and do something that isn't club activities - drinking tea, for example. 
 
 
Animation 
 
There's not really much for me to say about animation. As one would expect from Kyoto Animation, the art and animation of this anime is generally well done, particularly the attention to detail regarding the club's equipment. At times, however, the colours in the background would seem a bit dull, though this was counteracted by the characters. 
 
 
Sound 
 
This is where K-On! truly shines. The BGMs, although not too memorable, generally fit with the current on-screen situation. The OP would probably fit onto my top 50 anime opening list, if I were to ever make such a list, and the ED gave off a music-video feeling, with a catchy tune to go with it. 
The episodes that focused on the Light Music Club actually doing music were the highlights of the show for me. The insert songs were great if a bit odd, but unfortunately, only two or three episodes actually had real performances done by the club; the rest were spent on the girls going about their daily lives, as you'd expect from a slice of life show. 
 
 
Characters 
 
There was not a single character that I really disliked throughout the show. Their interactions are the second highlight of the show, with the voice actors really bringing the show's comedy to life. Aki Toyosaki and Yoko Hikasa in particular fit their assigned characters - Yui and Mio, respectively - better than I expected. 
With one or two exceptions, each named character served a purpose towards the story; for example, Yui's best friend Nodoka Manabe, is a member of the school council and generally appeared to move the actual plot along in the form of pushing the club for various application forms. 
 
 
Final thoughts 
 
Overall, K-On! turned out to be better than I expected. I had heard good things about it, so that set some expectations, and they were met, but not really exceeded. 
So in the end, I'd recommend this show if you're looking to take it easy after a shounen action, or just want to kick back in general. 
 
I hope you enjoyed my first review. If there's anything you disagree with, post a comment. Thanks for taking the time to read it! :)

    The first time I found out about K-ON! I thought ""Slice of life is boring. Why would   people decide to watch something like this?"" But when I clicked 'Play' I was totally wrong. 
The art is based on moe which a cute type of anime and I think the type of moe they used in K-ON! is quite enjoyable. 
I'm sure everyone can relate to a character in this anime. I can relate to Yui the most. The first time I got my piano I didn't even want to touch it because I thought I might ruin it! The music in K-ON! is something you'll love. The ending song is my absolute favorite. 
Overall, I found K-ON! something you'll enjoy since it's based on everyday school life.

    Today my review is on.... K-on! Season1! So lets start. The thing that made me want to watch this most? The art, the music and I saw it a lot in AMV's! 
Whats my opinion of the storyline? 
Well It has its ups and downs but my least favourite parts where when they were slaking off and their conversations didn't make any sense!  
 
Opinion on art? 
The art was done by kyoko animation so yes I really enjoyed the colourful art involved in this anime! 
 
Your favourite song? 
I don't remember the songs names really but I remember fuwa fuwa time I think it was called was my favourite 
 
Who was your favourite character? 
Yui,Ritsu,mio and Azusa! I didn't really like mugi. Hahaha. She wasn't really involved as much and she was always the rich girl who had no worrys. I also did not like Ms. Sawa or whatever her name was! She was just an obsessive gothic teacher to me and she bothered me at most times! 
 
My overall score nine! Great anime definetly check this one out!

    2018 and I still come back to this anime. And still listen the music in my phone. 
 
I think the best part of this anime is the song. If you love J-POP or J-Rock then most likely you will love it. Every sing they use inside the anime have their own uniqueness, and some of them pretty heart touching. 10/10 
 
Story wise there is not much to mention. Good enough for a musical comedy anime. The one thing that I can mention is how refreshing and funny the story. 7/10 
 
Art wise they did some extra work by making some MV for the song. Also the ED art is sooo good. Reminder this is a 2009 anime so it can't match 2017/2018 art. 8/10 
 
There nothing unique about the character. It's the usual shy, airhead, boyish, ojou-sama, and cat like character. Good enough for the job. 
 
I always love good comedy, happy go lucky story that you just enjoy it, no need to do hard thinking.

K-ON Season 1 Review. 
8/10 (Please read the rest) 
Now i am not the biggest slice of life fan but even i can find some enjoyment in the genre. At the tip top of this genre is a little show called K-ON. K-ON is one of the only shows i have seen to work so well with the formula of cute girls doing cute things. To critically review this show wouldn't do it justice as its not supposed to be looked at as a critical masterpiece in the likes of Evangelion or Serial Experiments Lain. This show is just a ball of fun topped with good art and music. 
 
To debunk the common saying that this show is about music, its more about the character interactions with one another and the comedy that follows. Music is just a backdrop to make events happen in the show.  
 
K-ON is cute and moe but that doesn't stop it from being fun. This show isn't as cringy as other shows that try to be like K-ON. It has a nice blend of comedy that doesn't seem that forced. K-ON does have some generic tropes in the characters that make them cringy and predictable but its sometimes overshadowed by lovable characters. As cringy as it can be, it still manages to be fun. 
 
K-ON isn't a perfect show as the voice acting in the dub and sub is weird at times. In addition, the show has a soundtrack that sounds good but is out of place sometimes. The comedy can be subjective from person to person. The comedy can be a bit repetitive and dare i say it, annoying a few times. 
 
To sum it up, K-ON is good and deserved to be watched. Sure, it may have some negatives aspects mainly being repetitive and predictable but i don't feel as if thats a issue that you should take into major consideration. K-ON has the good mix of a nice soundtrack, nice visuals, and great characters. 
 
8/10﻿

    Well when u just take a look at K-On! its a pretty simple anime..the story isn't anything extra ordinary..its pretty simple and actually nothing much happens in the first season..but when u watch it you'll get this feel to it..that's how this anime got loads of fans. 
The best thing about K-On! is of course the character design..the characters are just adorable!The voice acting is very well done..the art is pretty good too. 
On overall I'll rate this an 8/10   ^ ^

    So my reviews are short and to the point and will also be breaking the anime 'K-ON!' into 5 parts: Story, Art, Sound, Character and Enjoyment... so please enjoy my opinions and review on 'K-ON!' 
 
Story:7/10 
Although this is one of my favorite anime, the story was a let-down for me to be honest. Sure this anime is a slice of life anime and usually those kind of genre doesn't necessarily need a plot behind it but looking at K-ON! the story was abit jumbled and out of order, each episode had different perspective and did have some hint on a storyline but ehh.... but this is just my opinion  
 
Art: 9/10 
The art of K-ON! was very impressive and clear. Loved how they portrayed the statue of the principal (I think?) in different themes and the use of crisp and bright colours brings out that comedic and slice of life genre out which persuades the viewers to watch.  
 
Sound: 10/10 
I loved the music and BGM in this anime, of course the anime is based on music and should have decent sound but man the music the band creates is very addicting and cute. I wouldn't mind listening to the OST of the anime or even listen to the actual band's music over again.  
 
Character: 10/10 
The development of each character in the anime is awesome, the interaction between each character is also good. Each character has unique and very funny traits and the voice actors of each is on the spot, perfect. Although i wish one of them had more on-air time (it's okay mugi-chan :p) 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 
The comedy and pace of this anime is enjoyable and funny. Each episode has its moments and comedic times and is spread out evenly throughout, the way i like my comedy animes :L 
 
To conclude this, if you enjoy laughing and watching cute 'moe' moments i believe giving K-ON! a watch, this will not disappoint in that department will surely leave you laughing and might even re-watch again :)

    K-On is essentially cute girls doing cute things but with the aspect of music it ties in nicely. A nice way to showcase great music with a little backstory to that. Each character has a truly different personality which makes up a great group of friends. Very relaxing and chill anime for anyone who just wants to see cute things. 
 
Story-7 
I'm not gonna lie, the story wasn't really up there from all the other slice of life anime. However, judging slice of life and moe from the story isn't really good because story isn't really focused at all. 
 
Art-9 
Great art style that helps us understand how to characters feel and even lets us laugh. 
 
Sound-10 
Cute moe girls playing awesome songs? Priceless. The songs are catchy and well put together. The other sounds are normal. 
 
Character-8 
Characterization is important. It lets us know about the characters a little more to understand them. Each episode, it seems like one girl is in the spotlight. Or they are all equally shown. There's never a time where I'm saying ""Where is this character"" 
 
Enjoyment-9 
I enjoyed it a lot. I just wished the ""problems"" were a little bit more serious. Not the entire plot. But the problems or conflict in this anime seemed solved easily or the conflicts were solved because of a characters emotion. Pretty much the easy way out. 
 
Overall-10 
If you like Slice of Life and Moe, go for it. Just don't expect for it to be all ""serious"" 
I enjoyed it primary because of the characters, they fit right in and they were made for each other, along with the songs. Very catchy and enjoyable.

    It's clear that K-On had a substantial impact on the slice of life genre. It's been 7 years since it came out, and since then both SoL and anime have evolved. Some 2016 tropes don't seem present before K-On, and as a result it's hard to judge it without giving in to ""Seinfeld Is Unfunny,"" that successfully innovative ideas become commonplace and then the source seems unoriginal for attempting them.  
 
With this in mind, a few other things are worth noting. While some SoL's have very intriguing story arcs, the simplicity of the resolutions and even the driving conflicts makes the plot okay, but really not the defining feature. Some challenges are thrown in repeatedly that are resolved without any new character dynamics or revelation. They seem to be there just to pass the time. While it's expected for SoL's not to be plot-driven, it's also expected that the story has some impact on the characters or the viewer's understanding of them. This often isn't the case.  
 
In contrast, the characters themselves are all very well developed. Some traits are introduced and then forgotten, but the characters do have arcs and the dynamic between them is heavily developed (Again, largely outside the plot). They're all believable and empathetic. There is a noteworthy near-exception, Ritsu, a protagonist who feels pretty underdeveloped for much of the anime and it seems like she plays a role only when one of her couple defining traits becomes relevant, and consequently appears a bit flat.  
 
The music is okay or good, but doesn't really seem to stand out in any noteworthy way. Also, the art fluctuates often between great and generic. They act to help convey everything else, and that's fine. There's no shortage of fanservice, but it's not overwhelming. Overall, it's a rather enjoyable show but by the end it feels like they draw on some of the same things too often.  
 
If you're looking for consistently amazing art/music, a strong story, something very unique, or meaningful challenges/conflicts this probably won't appeal to you much. If you want a cute show with likable characters and you don't mind some things seeming generic from reuse since, which was my context for the overall rating, this is worth seeing.

    I watched this on a whim several years ago, due to it becoming popular among my previous group of friends, and the appealing art style.  
Normally, I HATE anime that is moe fanservice-based and has no pretty males, but K-on may be one of the few exceptions to this. 
 
The reason? 
 
Well, the reason I hate such anime in the first place is because I am a feminist, so you can imagine that I hate seeing girls sexualized and used as nothing but pure fap-material(which many men do even for this seeminigly-innocent series). 
 
The reason I was able to tolerate and even enjoy this anime(enough that I would spend $200 on a Tsumugi doll), was because I felt they made the girls somewhat realistic and NOT degraded for moe anime standards. Surprisingly, they weren't sexualized, and they were adorable without being over-the-top annoying like most cutesy anime girls are. 
 
STORY: 
The story was like any typical daily-life anime I had seen before, except, I felt that it was very well-done for daily life anime standards. Something about how they paced it, or perhaps because of how they built up your excitement, it felt pretty good, despite how typical it is for a musical slice of life, when you stop to think about it.  
Actually, this anime is what encouraged me to go and finally get piano lessons! 
Really, the only thing I didn't like of the story was when Mio fell on the stage and accidentally revealed her underwear, as up-skirts are one of my least favorite things about ecchi, but it relieved me that they did not actually show it. 
Also, there is no real conflict at all besides deadlines, grades, and getting Yui to learn the guitar(which she learned quickly). I personally think it would have added to the story if the girls at least had some sort of relationship conflict with each other, and maybe resolved it later on? Maybe if they had a rival at least? 
 
ART: 
It's either the art/animation or the music that makes this anime exceed my expectations. I don't quite know how to explain it in one word, other than ""juicy"","" squishy"", or cute. I really quite love how they drew the characters' eyes and faces overall, and the movement in animation is really fluid, even little things like how their facial expressions change. They don't skim on their facial movements even when they're seen in chibi expressions. The art style for K-on is actually pretty unique, at least until some new anime series' with the same art-style came out afterwards. It will always be the ""K-on style"" to me, though. 
 
SOUND: 
Probably the best thing, along with the art/animation(possibly #1, though), is the music in this anime. Even to this day, years after the anime was at peak popularity, I still have some of their songs on my playlist. The music in this anime makes it a legit music anime that far exceeded my expectations that I had due to some of my friends saying ""only creepy otakus like K-on"". 
Although, I am not too fond of the super cutesy soft-sounding songs, I absolutely love the rock-type songs like ""Don't say Lazy"" and ""No thank you!!"", as they are so catchy, energetic, and uplifting without being annoyingly cute(the lyrics definitely are cute/happy). 
I should also add that Mio's strong voice in those two songs is quite empowering to hear in comparison to the soft pop songs. 
 
CHARACTER: 
As a person who generally hates cutesy anime girls... I felt that the characters were really charming. I would say that Yui and Mio were my favorite characters personality-wise, and Tsumugi my favorite design-wise(and because she plays the synth/piano). 
I can't say I was too fond of Azusa, but she is definitely cute design-wise. I love her eyes. Other than her design, though, I felt like she was too boring of a character besides the whole cat ears thing. 
One thing I particularly like about the character designs, is that they are not anorexic. They have realistic weights and heights typical of Japanese females in high school, and they get self-conscious about fat just like real girls(but not as annoyingly persistent). 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
This anime was pretty enjoyable for me. Normally, a non-comedy slice of life anime would have long periods of boringness, but this wasn't. It kept you excited through each episode, and something would always happen. 
Watching this kind of felt like I was becoming friends with them myself. You kind of feel like you're a part of their world, and growing with them as new friends. 
While watching this anime, this kept popping into my head: ""Are you sure this is made for guys? It's too innocent and girly and friendship-y... It feels more like a cute shoujo anime, only without boys/romance!"". 
 
Overall, it's a good anime that is definitely above average compared with other slice-of-life, and I would recommend it to anyone who has free time and wants to watch a light-hearted anime.

    I was having a quick look through the shows I'd reviewed, and really only this, Kids on the Slop and Angel Beats I haven't reviewed, so, this being a favourite (I keep using that word, will have to compile a list!), I thought I'd get on with a review! Let's journey together folks:- 
Story:- The story, surprisingly enough, centers around a highschool student, called Yui. She's cute. I love her. I love all the girls in this anime. And I will get on to the later. Anyway, she can't decide what club she wants to join at school (is club joining compulsory in Japan, or just a ""safe"" anime plot?), but finally decides to join the Light Music Club, along with Ritsu, Tsumugi, Mio and, later on, Azusa, or cat-girl as she will be reffered to from now on. So, as a band, do these girls work hard every day, and produce some amazing songs? Do they b*lls. You want to know what they do? Sit around, eating cake and drinking tea. No darn joke. Anyway, the first few episodes revolves around Yui trying to raise funds to buy a guitar (WHY?! Why join a music club without an instrument?). She sets her eyes on Gibson Les Paul (who, for you who aren't into guitars, is a beautiful yet dead expensive instrument), but decides she wants it. She doesn't raise the money, but that's OK, because Tsumugi's parents OWN THE DARN SHOP ANYWAY! It deserves a 6/10. 
Art:- The art is very lovely, being your average CGI usage. Nothing splendid, and CGI shouldn't really get points anymore, but it just is so nice. I like it. It's crisp, it's clean, it's just ooooo. Oh, and there's a beach scene. 5 girls, at a private beach hut (because Tsumugi has too much money, well, her parents anyway). 8/10. 
Sound:- Now, I've mentioned this is a ""musical"" anime. I've also mentioned the lack of songs. However, there are around (no, really) two or three tunes. They're good. They're kinda pop/rock songs. I liked them (or at least, what I remember of them). 7/10. 
Character:- THIS is why I like the anime so much. The girls are adorable! And they're funny, cute, energetic, KAWAII bundles of fun! Sorry, I apoligize for basically saying the same word three times, but just look at Yui's face. *looks up at poster on wall* - just, oooooo, wanna just pinch her little cheeks! I'M A MAN. GRRRR, MOTORBIKES AND SH*T. GGRRR. They are litreally why I rate the anime so high. Really, it's blackmail. If it weren't for the girls, there wouldn't be a second season, nor a movie. But that said, when so much goes into making these characters, you can't help but rate it high anyway. 8/10 from me!

    Let's start out this review by saying that I love cute girls doing cute things so this review wont be completely unbiased. Have you ever felt so down that you just wanted to watch a cheerful anime to bring your humanity back after watching such a grave anime? look no further K-on is here. 
 
K-on tells the story of 4, later 5 girls reviving a dying club. This club is the light music club. Don't expect this anime to be a very musical anime like shigatsu wa kimi no uso, instead it deals with fun and fluffy stuff. there's barely any practice between the girls. 
 
Let's get on with the review, I'd give the story a 7 since it never did have any plot, there's barely any practice between the girls, just cute girls doing cute things. What will make this anime make you stay is the cute art of the characters which is at 9. Now for the sound I'd say it's at about 8 since they're pretty good at their live performances. The characters are fun and interesting to watch so I'd give it an 8. For my enjoyment I would give it a 10 since I was so hooked on this series and I would recommend this in a heart beat to anyone who has yet to watch it. 
 
Overall this anime is really well made and I say go ahead and watch it, but hey, that's just my opinion on it.

    ""K-On! is about 5 high school girls who form a music club and more often then not, they forget to practice and drinks tea and eat cake instead."" 
 
First watch of the first season can be described as pleasant but boring. 
But, the second season of K-On!! is what made it one of my all time favourites. 
 
The atmosphere is light and fun. 
No real conflicts other than between the band mates who take practice seriously and those who just like to drink tea and eat cake. 
 
The interaction between the characters are what really brings this show to life, it can be described as loving friendships that you can't help but smile at.

    K-On is one the best anime around that you can find. From it's Art-style to it's music, this almost exceeds any expectation from a certain otaku who loves girl bands and oh! did I mention cute girls? 
 
 
First glance at the first episode, it looks like a SoL-type Anime (although it's not in everyone's opinion) but as you further progress through episodes you would find the cute sides of the girls and even some of their backstories. 
 
I gave this overall a 7 because the art style looks good, the music sounds good, character development looks pretty great and you can't almost hold your laugh from the comedy it provides. 
 
 
Honestly, it's good. It deserves a watch.

    I will start by saying that friendship animes are my favourites.  
I was not going to watch K-On! with the consciousness that i was going to watch a friendship anime series, so, knowing that it was super cute and moe moe (and so on), i was kind of not super-excited in front of it. My initial thought was something like ""Hmm... Another moe anime, yay..."".  
I was wrong. Definitly wrong.  
Let me get into it. 
 
Story: 8 
I gave K-On!'s story a mark of 8, because it's kind of the same of every slice of life. 
The show itself develops itself around a group of five girls in highschool, spending time together in a club, the Light Music Club (K-On, itself). 
The majour misconception of this anime, is that it doesn't have a story at all. That it totally not true. 
The growth of the main characters in the environment in which they live and do what they do is the true essence of the K-On!'s story. 
 
Art: 9 
I definitly loved drawings and animation in K-On!, although some scenes could have been better designed, but i suppose that was done on purpose from the producer. 
 
Sound: 10 
I love K-On!'s sound compartment. I love the songs, i love character's voices, i love general ambient sounds. All of them feel so damn real and... Close to reality. Watching the first series ending is more or less just like watching a music video on MTV or something like that. 
Character voices are amazing, they really reflect the true essence of the characters. And this is expecially applied in the songs.  
 
Character: 10 
I will never stop saying that K-On! doesn't want to be a music anime, just like some other animes. K-On! wants to be a friendship anime. K-On!, on the first episode of the first season, wants you to start growing with the characters of the story by enjoying their adventures, their laughings and their music. K-On! wants you to get close to its characters, expecially to the main five girls (Yui, Mio, Ritsu, Azusa and Tsumugi), and know them, grow with them and explore their growing friendship. 
K-On! doesn't want to be a music anime, or a moe anime. It wants to be a friendship anime between five well designed characters, who experience a visible growth during the series. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
I personally watched the whole series + movie three times, and every time that i watched it i only enjoyed it more. 
The more you know the characters in this anime, the more you want to watch the series, seeing their differences from the beginning to the end of the series itself. 
 
Overall: 10 
K-On! became my favourite anime of all time. I cannot use a shortcut to say why and how it became my favourite anime, because the reason itself stands in the emotions and relationship that the watcher builds and experiences through the series. 
That being said, i cannot do anything but recommend this series to everyone who loves watching animes that are not trivial and simple. K-On! is not like that. 
K-On! surprises you, makes you feel emotions, experience and feel friendship between the main characters just like if they were real. 
--- Kind of spoiler down below --- 
I watched the series in the graduation from highschool period. As you can imagine, in that period, where you're fully concentrated with the exams, you surely cannot realize that many highschool friendships will became memories, simply because life works like that. I went then to university, so our lives got kind of separated. 
K-On! actually ends like that. Four of the main characters are going to graduate, leaving Azusa, the fifth member, alone in the Light Music Club. 
Watching K-On! during my graduation was really painful, and tears were really going down fast. 
Even now, when i listen to the K-On! music in the car, i remember every feeling and emotions that this anime gave to me. 
So yeah, sorry for this review full of grammar errors (i'm not english :P) and repetitions. 
Just wanted to share my personal enjoyment of this, in my opinion underrated and misunderstood, series. 
K-On! <3

    Enjoyment: 10/10 (Really this is the only score that matters) 
 
	Friends are a virtue. You can pursue your dreams all you want but it’s never truly fulfilled without a little help from some friends. They’re there to help you and have fun with you. Maybe you’ll argue time to time, but in the end, you're just a happy family. That’s the heartwarming message K-On!. And while it’s a very happy and cute one, just like the anime, it’s hard to say that this show is something to write home about. 
 
        Before touching on why this isn't the most explosive of animes, I'd like to touch on how this is an anime everyone should watch at some point in their anime-watching life, and not just this season particularly, I mean the whole shindig. Start from season one to the movie and surely this series will bring no regrets; I wasn’t lying about this anime be a very heartfelt one. Not only that but what this anime pulls off animation wise is just unbelievable. Just take a moment to look at the instruments. The insane detail that goes into those drawings are insane. Do a side by side comparison and you’d be surprised at how precise the details are on those instruments. Couple that with the smooth animation and it will leave you breathless just thinking about how much time and effort must of went into just animating this show. Even if the show wasn’t entirely hand drawn and had use of CGI, it’s really impressive how they got the instruments to fit in so well with the cute, anime art style. On the music side of the spectrum, this is personally one of the only animes that I love the music so much that I'd deliberately watch the OP on every episode. It goes without say, this is indeed a music anime. And usually with these “moe” animes it’s all just annoying and cringe-like songs, but the adorable, pop-like Toyosaki Aki paired with Hikasa Yoko’s smooth voice, all with the support of the rocking sound of drums, guitar, and piano/synth, actually comes off as more of a legitimate, pop-rock band than just overblown, “KAWAII” music like Love Live. All this along with lovable characters and endearing moments of fun and troubles (like practically going through an identity crisis), this show is just absolutely rocking and should be given a chance as a stand alone enjoyable experience. But objectively, K-On! as it’s own individual first season is NOT a masterpiece. Heck, not even memorable at times. 
 
        While there are many nit-picky things that affect the show that could be talked at extensively, they are mainly just small things that can be overlooked. Specifically, the main problem this anime suffers from is the lack of impact. This is a very common situation for slice of life animes since they usually don’t have an overarching goal/plot that the characters have to overcome to keep an audience hooked. Instead, it needs to focus on the more comedic side to attract it's audience. And while all the jokes weren't bad, the jokes were mostly a hit-or-miss due to it's heavy focus on picking at their cuteness rather than actual comedy; at that point, we are just making fun of them like a bunch of bullies. You can see this happen in other countless 'moe' animes like Love Live! and Denki-gai. Just because a girl is embarrassed about wearing revealing clothing doesn't mean it's funny; that's called being a girl with a conscience. Comedy is about being clever with word play or hitting hard with the unexpected, and if you don't have that pure comedy for a COMEDY show, them what is this show then? A good example of this is the school festival episode or the formation of the Light Music Club episode. These episodes played off the characters misunderstandings, unexpected traits, and clever interpretations of situations. The great use of the character traits to mess with others is where the comedy is centered at, not the girls be them. Doing that would just reaffirm their behaviors and give them a sense of realism, as if they are real people, but nothing else like the Christmas episode (except Sawa-chan) and the Training Camp episode which is mostly the girls just being lazy or just being cute. There is no need to constantly shove them being cute this in our face, we understand that already and it gets repetitive. Admittedly, there are some funny jokes in those episodes, but not enough to hold attention. If the comedy was more witty, it could have more solid and memorable than what it is now if it weren't for the honest moments of living out the pure student life of high school and sisterly/friendly love. 
 
        Therefore, can you say that this was a bad anime? No, just a tiny bit above average (like a .1 over whatever average is for you). It's a very touching slice of life with great ascetics that drags half of most episodes due to uncreative jokes, but sure can be finished with satisfied hearts, and that's all that really matters with this anime. Find what you can connect most with this anime then just go with it. It for the enjoyment of connecting with a cast of characters that know how it feels to live life to the fullest with the limits you have; it's possible as long as you got friends, lame jokes and all that jazz.

    K-On! is one of those shows that gets tossed around a lot as a great example of a slice of life comedy, being one of the more popular examples of one.  I wanted to branch out and try some more modern anime so I took a chance on this as it is mentioned as a good starting point.   
 
Full Disclosure: I recently got back into watching anime after a very long hiatus.  Cowboy Bebop was the last more or less contemporary show that I watched, so that probably colors my opinion somewhat. 
 
I was hoping to see more about the struggles of putting together a musical performance and how a light music club would operate, but was a bit disappointed that each episode seemed to be more about tea and dessert time and screwing around than actual Light Music.  This could be interesting if it was a couple episodes before the story got a bit more serious/urgent, but it was the story in just about every episode.   
 
To be fair, the story does have somewhat of a progression of time in it, with various activities happening more or less due to the needs of a light music club.  Instruments are acquired, the girls work on the theory of practicing or song writing for a few minutes, and then they are back to doing pretty much what they were doing earlier, which is having a tea party and reacting to their situation in a clichéd way based on their character tropes. 
 
With regards to the technical, the art is ok.  Nothing spectacular.  Animation feels a bit wonky at times.  The sounds are done pretty well, the music that is performed does actually sound like J-pop, and the voice acting doesn’t give me any right to complain.  The opening and closing credits are catchy, and the other songs that are performed work as well.  This is the high-water mark of the show in my opinion.  K-On!’s major stumbles are story and character development. 
 
The characters in K-On! are not very deep or complex, and they pretty much have their one or two shticks that become a punchline repeatedly throughout the series.  I watched the entire first season and past the first two or three episodes, I had figured out what the characters were going to do in most of the situations they were presented with.   
 
The lazy characters were going to be lazy, the timid, serious one was going to freak out about something when she tried to get things back to serious, the refined one was going to make tea to calm everyone down, and the adult in the room was going to try to get the club into cosplay.  That’s basically each episode in total, with perhaps a school festival, beach, or holiday setting to break things up once every couple episodes to vary the weather a little. 
 
I understand that cute girls doing cute things is a part of anime these days, and in that, I suppose that the show delivers, as for the most part, they all play their cute reactions to the situations well, and things comfortably meander along, same as they ever were in each episode.  However, outside of the opening and closing credits, the Light Music Club seems to do precious little actual music composition and practice, which left me thoroughly confused, somewhat frustrated, and wondering if I was totally missing the point as people seem to love this show and recommend it as a must watch.  The whole show left me a bit mind numbed watching it.     
 
The big question that I’ve had a hard time answering after watching the first season is if the whole music club is really necessary to tell this story.  I’m not sure it added much.  I haven't watched the second season, and don't feel compelled to so I can't say if it gets better in that regard. 
 
All said, I didn’t get too much out of K-On!, as perhaps I was looking for something a little more substantial (I realize that may be misguided with a show like this).  When a song is actually played by the group, it’s decent enough to watch.  The problem is that this happens so rarely that it’s just not enough to really make up for the problem of it being the same thing over and over each episode.   
 
There are shows with characters that are interesting enough to make you want to see them interact in various situations and the comedy or drama involved will make it entertain you.  This show did not make me like or care about the characters enough to have that same reaction, but I could potentially see how some types fans could really enjoy it.  There are people who really like the cute character archetypes and the one trick thing, and this could end up working for them.  We all have guilty pleasure shows that aren't amazing, but they're comfortable and make us feel good.  Perhaps this is that for some people.   
 
Outside of watching K-On! because it’s well known, I can’t really say that there’s much to recommend here to someone who isn’t a fan of the slice of life genre.  It’s probably inoffensive enough to watch with just about any audience I guess so it could probably be something to watch in a club or something.   
 
Bottom line is that I think there are more compelling things to spend your limited viewing time watching.  I’m not going to recommend anything specific, but I’ve seen better more recent slice of life shows that left a stronger impression on me.   
 
It's not totally devoid of entertainment value, but I can't recommend this over other stronger shows.  You aren't missing much here.

    This is an overall review of the entire anime line. Possible spoilers ahead. 
 
1) STORY (9/10) 
 
The K-On! franchise tells a story of five girls in a high school music club. From the get go, it is clear that the show does not wish to move beyond the silliness and heartwarming-ness of slice-of-life comedies.  
This does not make the story ""worse"" as compared to other dramatic storylines. The story focuses on portraying the school life of a group of wacky and cute girls. It is clear that the story establishes a beginning in S1E1 and a conclusion in S2E24. 
The reason the story is rated so highly is because although it is true that the plotline barely moves unless it has to, it does not fail to portray a sense of progression throughout the series. Be it the realisation that fun times must come to an end, or the enactment of countless comedic scenes, it is not until the very end of S2 that viewers finally realise that have formed some kind of connection with the characters.  
A story that drags viewers in if they wish to lose themselves in this whimsical world is a good story indeed. K-On! tells us what the story will be about from the very start, then proceeds to fulfil that promise from start to end. 
 
2) ART (7/10) 
 
There is nothing outstanding about the art. This does not mean, however, that it is poor art. Just as we cannot explain why we love certain genres of music, we cannot explain why the illustrations here are, simply, good. A good attempt would be to point out the crisp, consistent, almost stencil like presentations of both the characters and settings.  
Whether drawings are pleasing is ultimately subjective, but to me, the art in this anime is pleasing enough. 
 
3) SOUND (8/10) 
 
As a music-themed anime, it would be in poor taste to invest less effort into the anime's sounds. Again, music is a subset of art, and is as a result subjective. 
I find the light and carefree music choices appropriate given the theme of the show. The songs composed by the K-On Club are catchy and mildly exhilarating.  
 
4) CHARACTER (7/10) 
 
The show employs cliches in anime character design, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. To create enjoyable, relatable or impactful characters is at the forefront of character design, and even though some may disdain the many cutesy moments the anime has to offer, at the end of the day, intrigued viewers come out of each episode a little happier. Given the light-hearted direction the show has chosen to take, it has done appreciatively well. 
 
5) ENJOYMENT (8/10) 
 
The show is enjoyable if you wish to relax after a long day, or are not looking to invest a boatload of emotions and thought into watching a rather lengthy series (and a movie).  
The anime intends to be fun, and should be watched for fun, and nothing else. To watch this with the wrong mindset would be to do a disservice to both the show and yourself.  
You will find yourself enjoying this show if you chill out as much as the girls in the anime do. 
 
6) OVERALL (8/10) 
 
K-On! cannot hold a stick to dramatic plot-driven shows or emotionally charged stories that impact viewers on a personal level.  
But most importantly, it DOES NOT NEED TO. K-On! is an anime that wants to have fun, and it does a wonderful job at it. The creators abuse their limits of not having any limits, and bring to life a crew of characters that are sure to cheer you up. If you're up for it.

    This review also apply for K-ON!! (S2) and K-ON! Movie because it pretty much the same. 
 
first of all 
this anime didnt have actual purpose. 
or, there is? 
 
why you even watch this moe show? 
of course you watch this to find enjoyment. 
 
this is ""moe"" genre anime. if you like this kind of anime. people will say ""Your taste is shit"" to you. 
or not? 
 
{[Story]} 
you cant say story in this anime bad, why? because it slice of life anime,  
what you expect from reality? dringking tea, eating cake, dringking mother fucking tea. 
u can't expect some serious shit in the story, like the character is dying ,etc. 
but the story progress is very consistent. 
 
{[Art]}  
what do you expect from ""moe"" anime? 
mind blown art/ graphic ? 
art in K-ON! is very flat, but it doesn't matter 
the background/location art is beautiful, and match with the color theme. 
Animation in the OP and ED also very smooth and very well made. 
 
Kyoto Ani is always making very good art.  
and the Animation is very good if you look back at 2010. 
 
{[Sound]} 
the sound is so good to hear, the OP and ED is always good. 
the soundtrack also good, it match with current situation. 
Insert song in K-ON! is pretty sucks, but its funny to hear, like ""Fuwa Fuwa time"" and ""Curry Nochi Rice"". 
 
{[Character]} 
the character development is so good. every main character have different personality. 
all of the character is always interesting and cute. 
 
voice actor is doing very good job. every voice actor is match with the character personality and design. 
 
{[Enjoyment]} 
Enjoyment is the most important in ""moe"" show . because, who cares about the story isnt it? 
i always enjoy every scene, their cuteness, stupidness, etc. 
if you like this anime, you will want to watch it more and more. because you always miss with their moe-ness. 
 
{[Overall]} 
this anime always fun to watch for me. 
i also know many people did not like moe anime, but at least you give it a shot! 
because K-ON! moe is not like ""moe"" this day.

    I'm disappointed with this anime because it would've received a higher score if only it hadn't introduced the new Light Music Club member. Her existence raised a concern I didn't even know existed: Why isn't there much actual band shenanigans? Then I remembered: Oh yeah this is a Cute Girls Do Cute Things anime where they're obligated to center 70% of it on cute tea drinking and cute cake eating while making cute noises and cute faces. All the aforementioned I actually do love in anime, but when you bring in a character whose sole purpose is to point out the flaw of the club and unintentionally make all the other members appear as one-dimensional douchebags, it's awkward.  
 
""Can we practice?"", ""When are we going to practice guys?"", etc. You've got three girls wanting to play around and have fun, while you've got the other two wanting to do the actual club activities. I felt terrible throughout the second half of the anime because all I see is this poor new girl being dragged along on all these different jamborees and forced to overindulge in food and fun. Then the other girls play it off as a comedic gag when really it's unpleasant. I want them to have unadulterated fun without coming off as completely insensitive and lazy douchebags. When you introduce a girl who conflicts with their personalities and quirks in such an awkward fashion, it gets thorny, making the viewing difficult. 
 
Overall, I'm glad I saw this anime because it does its job well: being cute and not much else. 
 
Oh, also the few times they do play their instruments and sing it's fairly decent.

    Every genre has its entries that define how you should do a show of this genre. K-On! is the king of CGDCT/Slice of Life-Moe anime and shows what to expect of the genre, it gives a good idea of if the genre is for you. 
 
Personally, I don’t need a great story of any story at all in a CGDCT anime or even basic things like character development. A good CGDCT-show can focus on its two main aspects: The cute girls and the cute things they are doing. Add some music of magic or any other fun thing, it should be fun, and you are on the best way to make an entertaining and light-hearted piece of animation. 
 
In K-On!, we follow four girls and their teacher living their carefree lives with drinking tea, eating cake and sometimes actually practicing for their band. There isn’t any bigger plot or conflict, they just handle different everyday situations with their different characters. Just like every Slice of Life show you’ve ever seen.  
 
Characters are the main aspect of any Slice of Life show, and K-On! Does a pretty good job here. Every girl has personality and are characterized enough to make them different from each other. We have the lazy, but caring girl, the adult, but shy girl, the over-energetic girl and the rich and calm girl. In my opinion, the teacher really stands out here, she tries to leave her wild youth behind and become the loved and respected teacher she wants to be, but she also wants to be friends with the girls and make daring costumes for them. The cast works well together and you end up loving them, not for a specific character, but for their interactions and friendship. Everything you could imagine them doing can be justified by one of the characters. They are having a training camp in a huge house at the beach? Mugi’s rich parents own it. Need some amazing costumes over night? Sawako can make them. Forgot to get permission for sleeping in school? Good thing we are friends with the president of the student council. 
 
Music is always matter of taste, but I really liked it because it's light-heated and really suits the girls' personalities. 
 
In conclusion, K-On! suffers from the same problems many CGDCT and SOL anime suffer from. If you the characters, the whole experience is ruined, because the whole show is focusing the characters. But if you start to like the characters and their quirks, you start enjoying every minute of the show, seeing their friendships develop and overcoming every problem they encounter. This season is in my opinion the weaker one of the two, in season 2 they do more interesting things and there is some conflict and character development.

    K-On! Is a show that bases its appeal almost entirely in the relatability and evolution of its characters and its ability to create a light, fluffy atmosphere that viewers, given the time, can easily fall into. This review will cover the essential elements of the series using the component-by-component format and will be pertaining to only the first season, as I have not seen the second. Enjoy… 
 
Story - 6: K-On’s story is enjoyable and light, which is all it really needs to be. The four girls come across an abandoned club in their high school, The Light Music Club, and the first two to stumble upon it, Mio and Ritsu, act as recruiting agents. Once they find two more girls to make it qualify as a club, the story gets going (by its standards). The following events are fairly mild and, objectively, uninteresting. If you find yourself getting frustrated watching this show after a few episodes for this reason, just keep in mind that a gripping plot couldn’t be farther from the appeal of K-On!; rather, what the show goes for is a story that exists as nothing but a blueprint of sorts for the characters to interact with and make their own. This is where the life comes from in K-On!. Of course, characters will be covered in detail later in the review, but I bring it up now because the show’s story is just about pointless without them. You might be thinking “then why aren’t you giving the story a low-ass score if it is so weak on its own”, and you’d be right about it being weak on its own, but what’s important to keep in mind is that, while the characters are tailored to the story and make it unique and interesting, the story is likewise tailored toward the girls and takes adequate steps to make sure they are all put in scenarios that work well with their characters, which is not something that is necessarily simple at all, especially looking at it from an entertainment perspective. All things considered, K-On!’s story is adequate and lays a solid foundation for the more intriguing aspects of the show. 
 
Art - 9: The animation and overall artistic flow of K-On! comes across as fairly simple and run-of-the-mill at first, particularly in its color scheme, I found. However, within a few more episodes, it becomes increasingly apparent that most of the way the show is animated is calculated and for a purpose. I noticed this almost bouncy feel in the manner of the girls’ design, particularly in Yui’s (which couldn’t be more fitting for her), and this helped in giving the girls’ antics, as well as the show as a whole, a more loving and airy tone unlike any other show I had seen. This is truly what hooked me about K-On! to begin with. Beyond this common factor, though, each girl in the band is animated a tad bit different, each having her animation tailored to her. Mio’s elegant, sturdy design is reflective of her level-headed, and almost mother-like nature toward the girls, Ritsu’s sketchy and almost sharp design is perfect for her off-the-wall shite, and Tsumugi is animated in a bubbly, lovey-dovey sort of style, representative of her role in the show as literally the girl who is made to be likeable beyond the point of being realistic. Aside from this, there is a general feel of completeness and attention to detail in all the settings the girls are in, contrasting greatly from the manga, which failed miserably in this department (as well as art in general). Another important thing to bring up about the settings and backgrounds is that they work to make up for the almost bland color schemes of the girl’s designs in some scenes. With that said, the art of K-On! is one of those previously mentioned aspects that brings the simplistic story to life, and is satisfactory in just about every regard. 
 
Sound - 8: The soundtrack of K-On! is frankly unmemorable, which is a shame because every other aspect of this category is absolutely stellar. The OP and ending are perfect and reflect one of the balances that is one of the show’s goals to flesh out; the dichotomy of the girls’ seemingly simplistic and joyous time together (the opening) and their individual insecurities (the ending). Of course, considering this is the sound category, I would need to mention that the music of each the OP and outro are perfectly fitting respectively, as well. In addition, the voice actors match this quality with beaming energy and engagement being brought to each of their roles, thus creating a feeling of consistency in what this show is producing sound-wise, as well as making the characters feel more lively and fun beyond their writing and artistic design. Overall, the sound in K-On! is good enough to match the other aspects of the show, which, considering how highly I regard K-On!, is saying quite a lot. 
 
Characters - 10: This is the selling point of the series, as K-On!’s characters retain a balance and chemistry that is yet to be matched by any slice-of-life, comedy-centric anime (or show, for that matter) that I’ve seen. Truthfully, the whole appeal of their bond as a band (almost rhymed) is that they build each other up and possess what each other lack, which varies from member to member. While this is faaaaaaaaaaaaar from the most original premise in existence, K-On!, if anything, is a testament to the argument that what a show (or any visual storytelling medium, for that matter) comes down to is not themes or premise, but the execution thereof. The way I see it, classic stories of all mediums, while built around solid themes, are not considered genius for their theme or message, but how the writer conveys it to the audience in a relatable and interesting manner; execution. Any oaf can say “my story is about friendship and the importance of bonds”, but not just anyone can make a cast of loveable characters using expert writing and art to make people give a shit about said message. I would summarize each character to further exemplify what I’m saying, but I’d rather just give an overview as to justify giving them a perfect 10, which is what I have done (and besides, I already covered in brief their personalities, excluding Azusa in the Art section).  
 
Enjoyment - 9: With a show that is so solid in virtually every category, I don’t think it comes as a surprise that my enjoyment of this series is high to say the least. The writing behind K-On! clearly takes into perspective the entertaining of its audience, as almost every scene involves the previously noted chemistry between characters, and the all-too-enjoyable art style. That said, the show did feel a bit slow in the beginning and I found myself constantly on edge over the fear that this was going to devolve into just another directionless, lackluster slice-of-life shitfest. However, as I continued, I found myself becoming strangely attached to the characters and the amazing amount of consistent badassery each had to offer. Later, as their insecurities became fleshed out, I felt sympathy for them, as well, which was the last piece in the puzzle of my complete admiration for the series. This caused me to acknowledge and respect how well this show knows its audience (including people who generally aren’t big slice-of-life fans). Virtually all tastes are considered and the show never pandered me too much with one thing. All in all, my enjoyment of K-On! is just about as solid as the show itself. 
 
Overall - 9: K-On! is a show that does exactly what it set out to do and more. As I have only seen a few of the light-hearted anime of its nature, I don’t speak from a place of expertise, but I can recognize a good show when I see one. This series is fun, charming, and relatable and left me with a sense of completeness after viewing it. An important thing to note about the seemingly trite theme of friendship is that it is not an inherently harmful thing to incorporate into a show, and that it gets its bad rep simply for being used in media that generally is pretty repetitive and pointless. Thus, an action-oriented fan such as myself can easily find a solid foothold to enjoy this show on. Giving this show a fair chance would be in any anime fan’s best interest, and I hope I presented my thoughts on the matter in a manner that is clear, interesting, and informative. 
Thanks for reading :3!!

     6/10 the story in K-ON! is not the best because it is basically the same events and problems repeated constantly throughout the whole series. 
 
7/10 the art is somewhat better i don't have any problems with it. 
 
9/10 the sound in this anime is fantastic the music they play is happy and upbeat and makes you feel good. 
 
 
7/10 the character development is alright except for Yui. 
 
 
9/10 it is a very enjoyable anime to watch for many people including myself therefore its overall rating is a 9 from me

    K-On is an outstanding anime. It's like Squid Girl, and Lucky Star in a way its a slice of life and the plot isn't very coherent. They will have like a main focus plot, but they really don't focus on it. THis is ok because the characters are fun and keep it lively. The show is pure enjoyment with no stressful story lines or confusion. The show is about 4 girls who form a band in the light music group (light music  = K-On). They sing really great in the show and everyone is so different that it makes you happy to watch :D

    I though that I would not have given a chance to a anime that involves 4 girls wanting to restart a light music club, also I have to say this anime has a very slow start and doesn't' get remotely interesting till Episode 5. Lets just say black mail peaked my interest. And the various character personalities sold me.

    Story - 7 
 
The story can be viewed in one of two ways: 
1- Yui's quest to join the Light Music Club and the club's attempts at playing shows, improving etc which is present in few episodes. 
2- A general following of the light music club's endeavours and their cutesy antics, this story being the more present one. 
 
If you're looking for a strong story driven and episodic anime then this most likely won't be for you, whereas if you want an anime that doesn't require a lot of thinking and allows you to zone out or just put on when you want to have a laugh K-On! should be right down your ally 
 
 
Art - 7 
 
The show's art isn't exactly great meaning it can be hard for it to stand out in a crowd but it is still nice to look at. The characters in the anime all tend to be easily distinguished from each other although during certain scenes such as when they are asleep the characters can be difficult to tell apart (especially Yui, Ritsu and Ui) 
 
Similarly the character's designs (cute girls, big eyes etc) are pretty similar to those of other characters in other moe; also taking from its ability to stand out in a crowd 
 
 
Characters - 7 
 
Although the characters are most likely based on the archetypes of most moe characters you shouldn't let that put you off 
 
All of the characters are easily likeable in K-On! with each of the main cast having their own role in drawing viewers in 
 
Yui (guitarist and vocalist) plays the role the ditsy girl that provides the set ups for a majority of the funny moments and bounces off of Ritsu's character very well 
- 
Ritsu (drummer) is best compared to a tomboy as she enjoys playing the drums and scaring the other characters (mostly Mio) 
- 
Mio (bassist and vocalist) is the serious character that usually tries to keep the band on track. She's also quite the scaredy cat which sets her up for multiple scenes of other characters scaring her 
- 
Asuza (rhythm guitarist) is also a more serious character that tried to keep the band inline. Asuza is the youngest in the band and often falls victim to being treated like a baby by Yui 
- 
Mugi (keyboardist) is the rich girl that allows the club to indulge in opportunities such as visiting summer houses during the holidays in order to practice and also provides the expensive treats that often distract the club from working. She is often seen taking pleasure in the simple things in life. 
-- 
Sawa Chan (teacher and advisor) acts as the club's advisor, she is more often than not shown as being a sweet charger l character that is loved by the students for her kindness and beauty however sometimes her character takes a full turn and acts more hostile due to her guitarist past 
 
 
Sound - 8 (Dub sound) 
 
Considering this anime is about a light music club and band the music is few and far between although the music IS pretty good when it does finally come into play and generally has an upbeat tone that gets your body bouncing even if you don't notice straight away 
 
The acting is also done well with the characters sounding pretty much as you'd expect: 
Yui being high pitched and cutesy to match her ditsy personality. 
- 
Ritsu having an almost raspy voice to match her tomboy tendencies. 
- 
Mio and Asuza both having serious voices for the most part to compliment their work-then-play attitudes. 
- 
Mugi having a high 'wow everything is amazing' voice to match her habit of being happy 90% of the time and finding everything (including silverware cleaners) to be cool and interesting 
- 
Finely Sawa chan for the most part having a sweet voice letting her maintain her image of kind teacher, while also being able to switch to a volatile, raspy tone when letting her inner rock star shine 
 
 
Enjoyment 7 
 
Overall the show is pretty enjoyable if you enjoy anime that don't follow a strong plot and generally don't have a very episodic nature. While watching K-On! you can relax, turn off your brain and just mindlessly tune in, all while being provided with laughs. 
 
You can also opt to be an active viewer, fully engulf yourself in the show and take in the show's small pieces of plot and receive a little bit more enjoyment from the anime 
 
 
Overall - 7.2 
 
In conclusion K-On! is quite enjoyable and is a good way to provide yourself with some laughs, it has likeable characters, catchy music and a nice art style so it'd be recommended that you watch it rather than take a pass on it.

    K-on was something that I initially thought was something that I would not enjoy. So I unfortunately skipped it for the past... say, 2 years. So I finally managed to watch the first episode and I had to say the story and the animations and art style were very much to my liking. I personally want anime to look nice and flow smoothly, which K-On did have. The characters, instruments, settings, and various items were very well drawn and matched the theme of the anime. But I felt that this was the icing and decorations on top of a very satisfying and moist sponge cake. Not only does it look good, but it tastes good too. The story is absolutely adorable, funny, and gets you everytime.  
 
The characters each have their own unique personality, and adds to the story plot. Did I mention that they were all very cute girls? That's another plus in my book. I could probably go on about why I love this anime and why I regret not watching it sooner, but that'll take another 5  paragraphs so I won't do that. As for dislikes... There wasn't much I disliked actually, tid-bits here and there that I noticed, but just aren't large enough for concern. But these are my personal thoughts, I love anime so I might be a little biased. But please give K-On a try if you haven't already seen it. You won't regret it.

    ( Guitar Riff ) K-on! 
 
As a quick description of the show is perfection un-perfected. Shows exactly how important progression is to a pretty stagnant genre. In the moments where the show shines it shines bright but in its slow areas it noticeable. 
 
Story: 4 
 
If such a thing as a ""slow start"" exists, it is present in the 1st season of K-on. Apart from the fact that the last main character isn't introduced until the sixth episode, there is very little progression until Azusa shows up. 
 
Art: 5 
 
A little disappointing to say the least. Inconsistencies in facial expressions and overall medium quality of the show make for a forgettable setting and atmosphere. 
 
Sound: 9 
 
Cagayake Girls, My love is a Stapler, Fuwa Fuwa Time, and Don't Say Lazy; They are some of the best anime songs ever. Cagayake Girls is an okay introduction that is a bit too energetic for the show. Don't Say Lazy on the hand is a better closer as it slower and feels a bit powerful witch is suited for Mio who is the character who sings it. The OST fits like a glove in almost every scene as it captures the mood of the scene. (on a separate note: if you can the best song that is from the fictional band is calles ""Happy!? Sorry!"" but does not show up on the show)  
 
Character: 9 
 
The lifeblood of any slice of life story is its characters and K-on! does not disappointment. Although a little cliche with adding an energetic character(Ritsu) and a tsundere(Mio), K-on does well to make the interactions between them as realistic as they are entertaining. Each character is easily likable for certain perks that the show doesn't completely overexpose. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
 
It will be very worth if you can get passed the first six episodes, which can feel like a chore and could've been done in three episodes. However afterwards the show is A-maze-ing. 
 
Overall the show is divided almost in half. The first half is inert and has little moments of merit. The second half is constantly moving and shines like diamonds. If you aren't patient enough to watch the first 6 episodes than you'd only need to watch episodes 1, 2, and 6 and fill in the blanks in between and you'll be good to go.

    K-ON! was definitely something that I could consider to be a very well done anime. This is obvious in so many ways, and it's safe to say that it should not be underestimated. 
 
The premise of K-ON! involves a group of high school girls who form a band through their light music club.  It might sound a little boring to some, but that all depends if you can handle a slice of life anime like K-ON!  Rest assured however, that this is not the only focal point of the series. 
 
For one, I personally loved the art.  It was unique in the way it's animated, and the characters are all drawn to be amazingly lovable.  In addtion, I would also say that this series might have some of the most likeable anime characters around.  While some might say they represent anime stereotypes, I will beg to differ in saying that they are actually unique enough to break the stereotype boundary.  
 
If you like moe, then this is definitely an anime for you.  I don't think I've seen such a cute anime as this one, and it especially gets more so with the inclusion of Azusa in the last five episodes.  There are not enough words to describe just how moe this anime gets.  K-ON! also made me laugh a lot, and it definitely has a lot of parts which will make you smile or grin without a doubt. 
 
Music, as the title suggests, is obviously one of the main things about this anime that make it so enjoyable.  I've always found myself attuned to jazzy and more danceable music, but I can't say that I did not enjoy the ending and opening sequences of K-ON!  The songs are quite catchy and they have a kind of 80s vibe to them, so if you're a fan of that, you'll definitely like K-ON!'s music. 
 
Storywise, K-ON! was relatively decent in that it focused mainly on the lives of the characters and the upcoming preformances that the light music club had to get through.  I never found any of this boring, luckily, so the anime doesn't falter storywise.  Character development doesn't happen much beyond the band getting more coherent towards the end, but the characters keep all their charm throughout the thirteen episode run. 
 
All in all, K-ON! is a very good anime, and definitely worth watching if you're looking for a good laugh, lots of moe goodness, and musical content as well.  I give it a 8/10 only because it didn't really blow my mind or keep me really attached like other animes have, but it was still very entertaining and enjoyable.

    K-On! Never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd enjoy an anime like this. Boy, oh boy. 
 
Story 10/10 
If you started watching K-on expecting an actual plot, then it is you who is lacking, not the anime. That's like going to a Michael Bay film and expecting to get a nuanced classical drama. It is a 10/10 story, precisely because there is no story or plot (or rather a minimal one at that). You can pick it up at any episode and follow along. Sometimes, you just want to kick off your shoes, cozy up under a blanket and watch a cute little anime, you know? And I cannot overstate the importance of not having any romantic aspect in this show. Seriously, if they had done that, it would've been a 2/10 show for me. Moving on... 
 
Character 10/10 & Art 10/10 
Imagine the cutest and clumsiest little dog you can think of. Now turn that dog into a human. You have Hirasawa Yui. 
 
How the hell can something be this cute! Props to KyoAni. With Clannad, Hyouka and Inu Yasha, they were already up high in my list. But now, with K-on, yeah... Yui's character and interaction designer, or maybe it was the manga artist who did this in the first place, you sir, are simply amazing. If it were up to me, r/aww would have nothing but K-on gifs and screenshots. 
 
Watching the Hirasawa sisters interact is simply, healing. Hearing Yui say ""Ui"" is panacea. 
They rank pretty high up in my top conversational duo list, after Araragi/Senjougahara, and Holo/Lawrence, and Hachiman/Haruno and Araragi/Shinobu, and Araragi/Tsuki, and... well, the Monogatari series is cheating. But you get the idea. 
 
Not just that, Yui just friggin lights up any and every scene that she is in. An MC that actually grabs and shines in every possible moment? It's Yui. No one can compare here. She 'makes' the show. And keep in mind, I'm not taking anything away from the other characters here. They're all so friggin adorable. It's just that Yui ties everything together. 
 
Sound 8/10 
All you voice actors, you simply could not have done a better job. But for a music oriented anime, it could've had some better OST. 
 
And finally, this anime might not be for everyone. People tend to expect different things from different shows for different reasons at different times. I was just frustrated by a couple of anime that I watched recently (Noragami, looking at you) and wanted to simply watch something where nothing happens. I'm really really glad I picked up K-On. Anyway, if you think, 'fun things are fun', you know what to do. 
 
Say, ""Moe Moe Kyuuun"" and give in to happiness.

    The Story: 3 High school girls named Mio,Ritsu and Tsumugi (nicknamed Mugi) are looking for Band Members for the Light Music Club, They find Yui , problem is she cant play an instrument, so the girls decided they'll teach her to play the Guitar.  
Although I love this Anime the Story is sh*t,they form a band but they NEVER practice and barley preform , all they really do is eat sweets and go places -__- 
The Characters: Yui: A Ditsy Guitarist  
Mio: A Shy/ Paranoid Bassist  
Tsumugi: A Rich Pianist  
Ritsu: A Tomboy Drummer 
Not much to say just that they all are super cute. 
Art: Fairly good for a Slice of Life Bi-Shojo anime. 
Sound: well it is a MUSIC anime (Even if they don't preform their music -_-) My favorite songs are Dont say LAZY, No,thank you! and GO!GO!Maniac.. Both the Subs and Dubs are good. 
Overall: I wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't like cute things and some what Annoying Characters .. Although I love this Anime ,I can see its Flaws

    [STORY: 3/10] 
""K-ON!"" is not a very story-rich or enticing show. It wants to be a slice of life, but one that does little to tell a good story, which is something pretty important for this type of show to do, or it just gets boring fast. Cute girls doing everyday things isn't enough to keep me interested. 
 
[ART: 7/10] 
The art is above average and the character design is very well done, but that's all I can say. Nothing is spectacular about it that makes it stand out besides the carefully crafted cute characters. 
 
[SOUND: 6/10] 
Characters can be annoying and loud, but the voice actors do a good job at least. Music for openings is pretty enjoyable, but otherwise it's pretty mediocre. 
 
[CHARACTER: 6/10] 
There are some enjoyable characters and some lackluster and generic ones, but the character design is done very well, as I said earlier. Nothing much to say besides that. 
 
[ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 5/10] 
""K-ON!"" could've benefited from a more interesting series of events that strayed away from the generic ""lets do club stuff and be high school kids"" idea that a huge chunk of these slice of life shows try to replicate (and only a few get it right). It definitely has standout character design, but lacks in most other areas and really brings it down to an average rating.

    Honestly I consider K-On a pearl. It's fun, light, well designed and with a really nice soundtrack. The protagonists form a diverse group, but that goes perfectly, there are nearly touching moments, but then give way to smiles and laughters. I can not get attached to each of them, they are so cute! I believe they represent the desire of team spirit and friendship that everyone wants to have, with the hope of forming a group that last forever. The episodes fly away and we are located at the end of the series without notice it. The rating I give is very high I know, but for the overall quality I think is more than deserved.

    I've seen the K-On! name around for years now, and had never really been interested, but figured it was on my 'eventually gonna watch these list' and it was it's turn in the line up. So, I started this anime expecting very little, and as far as story art and characters, this anime delivered exactly what I had expected. What wasn't expected was how enjoyable the delivery was. 
 
As a slice of life anime, stories tend to take a back seat to the characters and their interactions, what K-On! did was took extremely generic character types, relatively cheap looking artwork and somehow made something that melded these qualities together well. 
The background tracks never stood out, but that is maybe a good thing since you instead focus on the things that are happening and how the characters interact. To that same end, the BGM never hit a nerve for me in feeling out of pace or out of place with the show, so I would say their use of music to fit the scenes was done rather well. The music for the performances and bits where the girls are actually playing anything did seem to be well done and to the credit of the animation team, they did seem to take some note of hand positioning on the instruments while the girls are playing the instruments. 
 
While K-On! doesn't have any qualities that are revolutionary or groundbreaking, it delivers on just being very fun to watch. In a way, the show itself is a lot like the characters. No special parts individually, but when combined it somehow works well enough.

    K-On! Tea-parties, light-music and the most hopeless bunch of high-school girls. K-On! had only one mission, live up to my expectations after hearing so much from the community. Somehow it did just as well, and established another classic from our decade of anime. 
Whether you are especially here for the moe ambiance, or some music fanatic the average anime viewer must have seen or heard about this series. 
Let's start point by point the critic, of course positive, of this delicate anime. 
 
Story (7) : 
 
For the story part, it doesn't especially stand out. When it comes to aligning school and slice-of-life there is no much more to add, moreover most anime of those two genres are your cliched kind of road ; summer vacation, training camp, fireworks, clubtime, beach... 
Getting to the point, if it scores that high it is thanks to the storyline, that actually semi-exists, and the almost stand-alone nature of each episode. 
Bonus is it actually has an end, after the second season, and some satisfying one. 
Overall, the deed that we saw the progression of the music-light club is really settling nicely the second season. 
 
Art (7) : 
 
Solid artworks, there was nothing to say more. K-On! has many points that makes him do that high : its 1080p quality is the best quality I've yet to see in an anime (and most screen devices can't support higher), there was no CG or I don't recall every scenes, and I would approve if there are dancing scenes. In spite of all the scenes during the concert (or concerts?) are of good realization, especially the light kind of effects who are just fine. 
Special mention for the moe character design ! 
 
Sound (8) : 
 
The opening is of quality, because it made it through my playlist. Can we really congratulate this rating on a music genre anime, that I don't know, for it needs a certain quality. Overall I'm not peculiarly fan of the light-music genre, but maybe it's big in Japan. 
Sound effects must be fine, right? But I bet the soundtrack isn't all that awesome. 
 
Character (7) : 
 
Every character of the band is nicely introduced during the course of the first episodes, they all have their personalities explained and the basis of the comedy gags. So why do I love more Tainaka Ritsu than any other character? 
Other than that, there isn't peculiarly one character being '-dere' or else, so it's a big-up. 
 
Enjoyment (8) : 
 
It had this special mission to kill my time, but it gave me some more, and stayed as one of my five favorite anime for quite some time. Of course, because it included kind of this shoujo-ai feel, being school-life and slice of life and as well an hilarious comedy. 
As it respected every genre it wanted to be, did not take himself seriously, was highly entertaining, it really deserves more than this rating. 
 
Overall (8) : 
 
Really delicate and tender series to watch, hilarious and makes the time fly by. If one ever consider to recommend you this anime, then do so, at least for it being some really big classic. 
For those pleased with shoujo-ai, moe, school-life or simply comedy, this established series will wrap up your expectations and, as if it was a sandwich, slip himself down your throat (or here your eyes, and your ears, finally getting through your brain). 
After this little anatomy lesson I feel like adding, that Tainaka Ritsu is some tomboy best girl of a kind. Bakas.

    The Positive Side: K-on! Is often cited as the definitive “cute girls doing cute things” show, and on that end, it certainly delivers. 
The show follows four high school girls who form an amateur rock band and learn to play.  The four main characters all have distinct personalities and quirks, and it can be a lot of fun watching them goof around.  Yui is an over-grown child, fun-loving, naïve and easily distracted, but in the rare moments she manages to focus, her energy and passion is inspiring.  Mio is the brains of the group, keeping the less dedicated girls on task, but her authoritarian attitude is at odds with her self-doubt and constant fits of panic.  Ritsu is the cavalier and irreverent tom-boy, perpetually teasing Mio.  Mugi, the rich girl, is the most soft-spoken member of the group, but she has an inquisitive nature and a desire for personal accomplishment that separates her from the cliché of the rich, spoiled brat.  While the characters are exaggerated, they each have a certain emotional depth, and play off each other quite well. 
While there is quite a bit of slapstick, some of the comedy is surprisingly subversive and original.  The series opens with our heroine running late for the first day of school.  I flat-out rolled my eyes as she dashed down the street, obligatory toast in mouth, facing numerous delays before bursting into school… and immediately realizing that she misread the clock, and wasn’t late at all.  Realizing how badly my own cynicism and knowledge of clichés had misled me, I had no choice but to laugh, both at the cleverness of the gag, and at myself. 
The central goal of the rock band the girls form gives the show more direction than some Slice of Life series have, though this also can make it a bit frustrating that more time isn’t spent on the advancement of the band.  Appropriate to a series about a band, the music is very well done.  The opening theme has a peculiar blend of heavy metal and J-POP, with a driving, energetic beat that is sure to get stuck in your head. 
 
The Negative Side: While the comedy is usually pretty solid, the show makes a running gag of Mio having constant emotional break-downs, and this is honestly more uncomfortable to watch than it is funny.  There are also a few rather Haruhi Suzumiya-esque molestation jokes, but these are kept comparatively mild and infrequent.  While the music is catchy, the lyrics are pretty vapid, and the soundtrack is rather limited.  None of these, however, are the biggest problem I have with the series. 
The biggest problem I have with this series?  No lesbian make-out sessions. 
…I’m being serious.  Wait, don’t close the review yet, I’m going somewhere with this, I promise! 
There’s something supremely unsatisfying about a show where everyone is obviously gay, and yet no-one is allowed to have an explicit gay relationship.  There’s little excuse for this kind of timidity when Sailor Moon gave us an out-and-out lesbian relationship all the way back in the freakin’ 90’s.   
If the series’ homoerotic overtones were played purely for comedy and fanservice, I think I’d be able to forgive the lack of relationships, but K-on! tries to have it both ways, playing lesbian attractions for drama without actually admitting that said lesbian attractions exist.  Episode 11 centers around Mio spending time with Nadoka (a girl in her class) and Ritsu becoming jealous as a result.  Ritsu tries to hide her feelings, playing around and teasing Mio as usual, but her jibes are noticeably more mean-spirited and unnatural.  The other girls notice that something is wrong, and make anxious, desperate efforts to lighten the mood and continue their practice session.  Ultimately, these efforts fail, and Ritsu leaves in frustration and disgust, claiming she can’t play today.  After getting to know the characters, this is a genuinely painful scene to watch.  It’s obvious that Ritsu has feelings for Mio, and equally obvious that she needs to come out and express those feelings.  And at the end of the episode, she just, sort of… doesn’t.  Her feelings of jealousy magically go away, and the show continues like nothing ever happened.  Mio spends some time with Ritsu caring for her while she’s sick, which is sweet, but neither of them makes any kind of meaningful approach towards the other. 
So… why not?  Why, after the obvious emotional turmoil and build-up does the series fail to deliver any kind of meaningful emotional climax?  Are the writers simply afraid of screwing up the show’s dynamic by introducing a romantic subplot?  It seems a bit odd that they would display that level of attachment to the status quo when they introduced a new major character half-way through the series.  It almost feels like the show is fetishizing homosexuality, portraying homosexuality as something too taboo and naughty to be portrayed openly.  
While K-on! succeeds as a slice-of-life comedy, it squanders its own potential by refusing to admit the relationships it teases.  While I enjoyed the characters and came to care about their struggles, I couldn’t help but feel that they emotionally fenced-in by their own writers.  While it’s not a bad show, I don’t recommend anyone rush it to the top of their “To-Watch” list, either.  If you want a light-hearted comedy about cute, gay schoolgirls, go watch Sakura Trick instead.  The music isn’t as great, but it also doesn’t keep its lesbians suffocating in the closet for thirteen episodes.

    This show is like staring into a bright shiny sun of cute anime girls doing adorable things. That is the best way I can describe it to you, I cried at random parts of the show just because my body had reached its holding capacity for cute... 
 
This was my first true Moe show that I have watched so if you are a newbie to it like I was I recommend getting your start here! The characters are beautifully drawn as well as the backgrounds which really help immerse you in the show. It is very impressive, the level at which they animated this show given the what year it was when produced. 
 
The show was great because of the cute characters, the beautiful art style, and the music! I don't really know how to put this any other way but... watch this show if you like cute fuzzy things I guess. That was a metaphor of course, I was not speaking literally lol, although they are very cute.

    4 Girls in High School start a band...what's not to love??? 
 
So K-On! is our journey into Sakura High, where the ""Light Music Club"" is in need of a guitarist. Yui, who wasn't expecting any of this from the club, suddenly finds herself in a band and cranking out tunes on her lovely Gibson Les Paul.  
 
The story arc is there, unlike some SoL comedies, so that was a big plus for this one. It does a great job of balancing out the main story with happenings and little side stories that add to character development. It's also a fairly good pace since everything being about band struggles would make the story go stale kind of quick (been there, done that). Some of the tropes used in all animes are there, but the show is masterful at how/why they find themselves in these locales. A rehearsal space that's at a beach house is much better than just ""Lets go to the beach because...reasons!!"" as an excuse to see the girls in bikinis. It has the common elements, but with enough of a twist to make them more believable.  
 
Art was pretty good, but seeing more of the girls playing along with the music would have been nice. It was cool when it did happen, but on a few scenes you felt kinda slided when they would skip the performance. It's not a super big gripe, but I felt it detracted enough from the show to mention it. The instruments all look great and the music videos are so cheesy that they are just freakin awesome....but I'll save that for another section.  
 
Sound...the acting and of all things the FREAKIN MUSIC is AWESOME in this anime! Yeah, the OP is a little poppy, but a lot of the songs have a kick to them and are well-composed. I would argue that the ending theme ""Don't Say Lazy"" is perhaps one of the coolest songs from an anime I've ever heard (even better than ""Between You and Me"" from Kuragehime, my previous favorite). To get off that for a moment, the voice acting seemed pretty good in the sub (which I opted to watch instead of the dub). The girls personality and cadence shines through despite the language barrier for me, so it makes the sub pretty enjoyable to watch. I'd highly recommend skipping the dub on this one, not sure how they handled the songs they performed, but that may be interesting to watch (I'm guessing they just did them in Japanese). The song titles are hysterical as well (My Love is a Stapler!!), but I can't talk enough about how much I like ""Don't Say Lazy"", just do yourself a favor and jam out to it when you get a chance.  
 
Characters were neat and enjoyable, though the mix on some of their personalities seemed to be strange choices (Mio is a scaredy cat?). I really thought the dynamic was fine from the get-go with all the girls, but later on Azusa seemed to be a pretty useless addition IMO. She's kind of mousy and quiet like Mio, but without as much focus on success or artistic brooding. They tried to take Mio and mix her with some Yui moe elements, but it feels like she gets in the way all the time. Why mess with something that already works? It's like making Pinky and the Brain and Larry...all you are adding is more characters for a couple of moe jokes that just felt useless. Every time I look for merchandise, I always want it with just the original 4 girls. Azusa aside, all the other side characters seemed to fit and felt natural. I'm a bassist so I think Mio is cool, but I really do like all the girls (except Azusa).  
 
This show totally deserves a perfect score on enjoyment from me. The music is great, the stories and jokes are enjoyable too. The band elements and musical jokes/references make it all the more entertaining for me since I play bass and guitar as well. I'm sure the story arc has been done before, but it felt more unique than many of the SoL comedies I've seen before so it was a welcome change of pace. You get excited to watch the show and it makes me want to pick up my bass or guitar afterwards and jam!! Definitely puts me in a good mood.  
 
 
 
All in all it's a great show, definitely worth watching if you are into SoL comedies and a MUST see if you are a musician in any capacity. Get ready for the songs to be stuck in your head for days on end, but the thing is you enjoy having them in there! I'd say the only negatives are the performances they skip in the show and the addition to Azusa which I felt was the big blow to this anime. Without Azusa being in there, I would have given this show a 10 overall, which I don't give out lightly. She'd make a better side character or perhaps a fill-in or sub for Yui in an episode or two, but making her a main character just felt like dead weight. It's a shame, I really wanted to give this show a 10. Don't let that keep you from watching it though, I loved it so much that I bought a t-shirt!!

    After reading different reviews about this anime, I prepared myself for the worst. Like no story, no interesting characters, no logic or morale, only fan-service moe and kawaii. It, of course, true in some ways, but completely untrue in others.  
 
I do not see much anime of this type (or any other) and do not truly understand what moe means, so I write about my fillings on this anime with regular words. 
 
First of all, this anime can cheer you up and calm you down after hard work, or even motivate you for doing what you want. And yes I am talking about K-On. Still, it is mostly kawaii and moe (whatever it means), so not everybody will notice anything else, except cuteness of anime.

All anime is about four (five) schoolgirls who love to drink tea with cake after school studies. And it is all. Oh, no, they also play in school music band, but mostly it is tea. There is no story and the whole season, and mostly there is no story at one episode either. It just events which can happen in school. No hard conflicts to resolve, no unsolved mystery to find out, no high goal to reach. Is it bad? Not for this anime. Girls just flow with events around them and give us their happiness and love. The story is not needed here, so let's go on. 
 
==Characters== 
They are great! It is generic characters, but that is not bad either. Absolutely naive and cheerful Yui, serious and fragile Mio, vigorous Ritsu and so kindness Mugi. Part of all of them live inside everybody (and this is good parts), and in this anime, they just divided into different persons. It is fun to looking on their mutual study and entertainment.  
 
==Music and art== 
I love OP and ED really much. (ED - is best motivation song of the last time). Also, there is decent music on their scene appearance. For me it's enough, but it is hard to notice that anime is about music club.  
 
Art - is good, I like this simple drawing. Simple but effective.  
 
==Enjoyment== 
Why did I enjoy this show so much? Because it fit to the real world. It's an ideal world where is no problem, and lady luck is at your side, it is the world where you dream can become true, people around are kind and ready for help. It looks so different to the real one, but it not unconnected at all. This anime make you believe, that real world is not so bad, and it really is. You can have some dream to follow, as heroes of anime do, and you always can had some tea and sweets with friends. There is no need to bury you child ambition and beliefs, sometimes it help to become happy. And this anime dig out this childish out of you.  
 
 
I do not recommend this anime to everybody, and my score is little overrated, but this is my filling for this anime.

    [Contains mild spoilers] 
 
At first glance, K-On could easily come across as just another cute anime about cute girls doing cute things. But what makes K-On rise where lesser anime fall, is in the way it tells its story. 
 
A commonly used trope in modern comedy is to create a static world and fill it with dynamic characters. This means that the humor then has to come from individual situations, since the world as a whole never changes or develops. A perfect example of this is The Simpsons, where the crazy adventures always are forgotten by the next episode. The world resets. 
 
This is where K-On differs in the best way possible. It doesn't let story suffer because of situational comedy; instead it lets the comedy serve the story. Every skit always seem to have a purpose in driving the plot forward. A good example of this is when the girls band together (pun intended) to earn enough money to buy a guitar. Sure, a lot of situational sillyness occurs during that scene; but because the story calls for the girls to get money, it doesn't feel like a sketch or a throwaway gag.  
 
However, with that being said, K-On's story really is a silly and light hearted one; which means that if it focused too much on the plot it would come across as taking itself too seriously. So it's all about finding that sweetspot between comedy and plot; and boy did K-On find it! 
 
I would also say that the character development in K-On is extremely realistic. A common criticism aimed at shows such as this one is that ""nothing happens"". And granted, every episode just seems to be about the girls sitting around drinking tea all day. ""Where's the story?! Where's the plot progression?!"", I hear you say with your voice filled with critique and elitism.  
 
But here's the thing, the fact that nothing seems to progress IS what makes it so realistic. Real life progression sneaks up on you. If you were to compare yourself with you from two months ago, I bet you wouldn't find a whole lot of differences. Same goes for you from two months ago and you from four months ago, and so on. And yet, I'm convinced that if you were to compare yourself with you from a year ago, he or she would seem like a completely different person.  
 
The same goes for K-On. Just because you didn't notice the changes, doesn't mean they didn't happen. If you compare the first and final episode of the series, you'll notice that a lot of things has changed. Four charachters that started out as complete strangers would now die for each other, and a charachter that had never played guitar in her entire life now rocks it out on stage in front of a huge audience. Where's the story? where's the plot progression? Well, it's right in front of you, just open your eyes. 
 
K-On isn't The Simpsons. The world never resets and the humor is never pointless. The world is dynamic and the characters have memory. And most important of all, it ends on a completely different note than it started on; without ever failing to entertain. This is why K-On is a great experience.

    The Story: 5/10 
 
 	It’s freshman year and Yui coming to the realization that she hasn’t done a goddamn thing with her life, realizes it's time to shame up and join an after school activity. She becomes interested in the light music club thinking she could play the castanets, but boy was she wrong, but she still feels obligated to stay in the club, so after a bit of awkward peer pressure she decides to continue to be part of the Light Music Club and learn guitar so she can continue to eat the delicious dessert Tsumugi brings in every meeting. The pacing of the plot is pretty minimal and the actual story is pretty bare bones, with slice-of-life high school problems filling out the moments that aren’t holidays or concert performances. I doubt anyone is really looking for a gripping plot when watching K-On! anyways they’ll probably instead have a squuuuuuueeeeeegasm at how moe each member is,and over  just how darn quirky they are. With K-On! it isn’t about the destination, but just how many adorable moments one can squeeze out of 13 short episodes.  
 
Characters: 6/10 
 
	First of all you got the MC, Yui Hirasawa she’s really naive and airheaded, but she can do great things if she puts her mind to it, oh she also loves sweets along with everyone else in the Light Music Club. Mio Akiyama is the bass player who is intelligent, shy, a bit of scaredy cat, and probably the most talented musician of the bunch, Tsumugi Kotobuki is the keyboardist, who’s thoughtful, nice, rich, and also a bit of an airhead (I feel like she is the least well-developed character of the group, although none of the main cast is all that well rounded). Ritsu Tainaka is the drummer and the club president, she’s a bit rough and is childhood friends with Mio, thought she acts really similar to Yui at times. Azusa Nakano is the final band member, and is the rhythm guitarist I assume. She’s a year younger than the rest of the members, and she is definitely the most serious of the bunch. I love her coming in, and being put off by all the tea drinking and cosplaying the LMC does during most practices, and I despised how they showered her with attention by forcing her to try on outfits and making cat noises it was pretty uncomfortable.  
 
Art: 7/10 
 
 	The show looks well enough for being in the moe slice-of-life genre and a lot of shows that KyoAni does tends to look pretty gorgeous (like the first image result when you type in Sound! Euphonium Reina I mean, wow). Everything about the art design is either sufficient or god damn adorable. The animation on the other hand is average overall, even the band’s performances don’t look all that fluid or smooth.  
 
Music: 8/10 
 
	K-On! doesn’t disappoint in the quality of the songs in the show, but I just wish that there was way more actually songs in the series, since I don’t remember very many. Both the opening and ending for season 1 are praiseworthy. The show is also pretty hard rock sounding during intro then blasts into a girly frilly rock song, that reflects that actual tone of subject matter of the show to a tee. It’s timid and precious at times, and then crescendos into a chorus of youthful exuberance  and rainbows and The Ending is exhilarating and really gives off the vibe that they are an actual rock band, and not some tea drinking amateur high school band. Also the costume design and transitions showing each band member and their instruments are really sleek and eye-popping. I love both the opening and ending for season one, and are my favorite parts of the series for sure. 
 
Enjoyment: 7/10 
 
Despite the rarely seen plot, K-On! can actually be addicting in short bursts, It’s like the sweets the girls devour every afternoon, it’s best short and sweet, and if you too many in a single time it will leave you with a heartache. It’s sort of the the anime equivalent of Animal Crossing, I mean it’s nice to check in every once in awhile to see how your town and neighbors are doing, but there is only so much you can do in a single visit, and can get boring and drawn out pretty quickly. The best this for sure is the music, and if anything just check out the openings and the ending for season one, and if your interest in the characters then watch the show, but if it those don’t do anything for you then don’t bother with K-On!.

    There are a lot of things I could say about K-On!, but to sum it up in one word, it's great. 
 
One of the main selling points for me, and I'm sure a lot of others, is the art. The art and animation are absolutely outstanding, and it's one of the main reasons I began watching the show in the first place. The crisp, clear lines and fluid animation really bring the characters to life, especially during their musical performances.  
 
Now let's talk about the characters themselves. There main cast is composed of four main characters, at least in the beginning. There's Mio Akiyama, the bassist of the group, Tsumugi Kotobuki, the keyboardist and my personal favourite, Yui Hirasawa, the lead guitarist and lead vocalist, and finally Ritsu Tainaka, the drummer. Each character has a very clear and distinct personality, and displays this quite well throughout the show, despite reusing a lot of the same type of jokes to do so.  
 
What about the story? The story is....less than stellar, compared to the rest of the show. A lot of the episodes end up having a lot of similar scenarios, like the group spending most of their time in the club room, drinking tea. Of course, this isn't to say the story is bad by any means. A good portion of the episodes try and keep a fresh topic, and generally accomplish that.  
 
Now, the music. The music in the show is really excellent. The songs they play are catchy, as well as the soundtrack throughout the show. The concert scenes are definitely among my favourite of the whole season, and these scenes are where the animation really comes to life, with the characters perfectly synching with the music they are playing. The music the band plays is really high quality, and it's worth replaying the scene just to hear the song again. 
 
Overall, the anime is very good, with a ton of excellent qualities. If there were any complaints to be made, it would be that the jokes get a little dry, and the story line wasn't the greatest. I hope people find this review helpful, and thanks for reading!

    K-on is about a club revived by 4 girls namely, Yui, Ritsu, Mio and Mugi. All with random character traits which you may find really entertaining and cute! A really worth to watch anime and if you're looking for a comedy musical anime along with a friendship related tag . K-on is one of them.  
 
What made it more interesting is the story isn't just about music, but also about friendship and a slice of life. All different but compatible with each other:  Mio the responsible but scared that makes us laugh and determined, Ritsu the prankster and good at beating the drums. Mugi the girl who's interested in new experiences and Yui the energetic air headed yet sweet girl.  
 
A funny, cute, beautiful anime you have to watch till the end.

    K-ON! is one of those rare shows that features music as the over-arching theme. It can be a hit-or-miss, considering who it is targeting to and what your own preference of music is. 
 
Story: 7 
The series follows Hirasawa Yui and how she gets herself involved in the Light Music Club. Even though she has little to no musical talent, she joins the club as their lead guitarist. The show was set to be simple -- nothing too fancy and nothing too bizzare. The comedic part of the series is extremely light and nothing that will make you burst into tears, but that's my own preference. 
 
Art & Animation: 7 
Kyoto Animation found that making shows more ""moe"" like would bring in the viewer's attention -- so they did it. Again, like the plot of the story, nothing too fancy. Each character was drawn to look cute with not that many details. The art for the ending was a lot more detailed, and that would've gotten me a bit more attached to the series if it was like that. Moe art for me, ehhh. It's not something I would prefer, but it works. 
 
Sound: 7 
Again, music is all about preference. It is a hit-or-miss for you if you like pop music. There is a big risk in making a series solely on music, since you don't have much to fall back on. The songs were meant to be nonsensical and also added a small part of the comical element to the series. Try reading some of the titles of the songs featured in the series -- it can be a bit odd. The lyrics are no different. Nevertheless, just about every song they have made is catchy and enjoyable. 
 
Character: 6 
I don't know what it is about having 1 of every character: 
Hirasawa Yui, the airhead and the main protagonist of the series. She gets the most development throughout the series, but it seems to lack at some aspects. (guitarist, singer) 
Akiyama Mio, a timid girl where memes of her spreaded like wildfire (Just search up Moe Moe Kyun and you will know what i'm talking about). (Bassist, singer) 
Kotobuki Tsumugi, the rich one out of them all that offers tea and cake just about every episode.(pianist) 
Tainaka Ritsu, the tom-boyish character of the series. (drummist) 
Nakano Azusa, the semi-serious character in the series only to revert into the fanservice cat cosplayer that everyone loves. (guitarist) 
 
What do they all have in common? Their enjoyment of tea and cake while being extremely lax most of the time throughout the entire series... and being extremely moe. They all have a single specific characteristic that only they can have, leaving a lot to desire in character development. It develops a bit more in the second season, but this is just a review for the first. 
 
Enjoyment: 6 
It wasn't really a show that got me excited, or pumped to watch the next episode. It was more of a, ""meh, i'll continue to see how it ends"". It became repetitive and my enjoyment level slowly depleted as a result. When Azusa was introduced in the series, it gave me hope that it may get a bit more serious, but I was let down as she got more and more affiliated with the Houkago Tea Time band.  
 
Overall: 7 
I am not saying this series was bad. The plot of the series was to get a bunch of girls together to play some music -- and they achieved that. After that, there wasn't much following it. If it's not music, you just follow their daily lives at school, which just about every anime has adopted for some reason. 
If you want to expand your pool of music and want to just sit back and relax to a series that isn't taking itself too seriously, watch it. Otherwise, it's not something that you have to be extremely eager to see.

    K-on is a joy to watch.  
 
This is candy in anime form, sweet, lighthearted and inconsequential.  
 
The sound and art design in the series is fantastic, with excellent camera work.  
 
But I think where this excels is in the relationships between the characters. Everything they do together is believable and you really feel like you're getting an insight onto the friendship between these girls.  
 
Some might say there's not a good enough storyline, but I don't think an overarching plot is important in this case. This is a slice-of-life, its supposed to focus on characters and how they interact, not deal with major morals and life choices.  
 
K-on! is a cute and beautiful show about high school girls being high school girls. I think it's Kyoto Animations best work and some of the finest in the genre.  
 
If you enjoy slice of life, you will enjoy k-on.

    OK so I couldn't care less about slice of life anime but this one caught my eye I don't know why but I'm glad it did.  
 
Art: The art was really good and that's an important factor for me.  
 
Characters: All the characters were just perfect for this show even though they were clichéd in a lot of things.  
 
Enjoyment: The show didn't run away from it's original plot and the ending was satisfying, it also had it's cute and funny moments. 
 
Sound: The OP and ED wasn't great so I didn't really pay attention to it and the songs they played live were to girly for me but they were catchy but annoying.  
 
Overall: It was a great show to kill time, really.  
 
Would recommend this if you want a nice paced anime to watch a rainy morning.

    This is not going to be some amazingly professional review, criticizing every last detail about why I like or dislike K-On!. Instead, this is going to be my personal opinions informally thrown out there to tell people what this show is about. If you're looking for a step-by-step breakdown, don't read this review. Also, this review will not contain any spoilers. 
 
K-On! revolves around the local school's Light Music Club, which is basically just a club where everyone in it is in a band and they create songs, play instruments, all that stuffs. When the first year of high school starts, 2 girls find out that the club is going to be disbanded due to lack of members (nobody is in the club), so they decide to take up the club and own it. Gradually more and more girls join and there ends up being 4 of them fairly early in the series. Later, a 5th, Azu-nyan, joins about half way through. Now, the main story of K-On! is... well... I guess it's about them trying to make music and become a well-known band or something...? But honestly it's about them eating cake and drinking tea. After school each day, they have their ""practices"" or ""rehearsals,"" but they don't actually do a lot of practicing or rehearsing. Instead, they mainly sit around and talk while eating cake and drinking tea, which is usually very comical. The main aspect of this anime isn't necessarily about music, but more about being cute and funny. Yes there are music aspects as that's basically the whole plot and story of the show, but it's not as dominant as you'd think. For me, I'm glad. I liked just sitting back watching cute girls do cute and funny things, all while stuffing their faces with cake and tea. That is basically the summary of this whole anime: Cute girls do cute things while being funny, also while stuffing their faces with cake and tea. That's it. That's the show. Now, when they actually play songs and etc. and preform concerts, the music is awesome. The sound quality throughout the whole anime is very crisp and nice, and the songs are cutesy and very enjoyable. The characters are very enjoyable as well, as I said earlier they're all cute and do cute and funny things. I really liked Mio who was the shy and scaredy-cat one of the group. They all have their own unique personalities and each one of them plays a different instrument. Well, I guess that's the review. 
 
Yes, I understand that this was a gigantic run on paragraph listing random facts about this series, but that's just what it came out to be. Again it's very informal and I'm just spewing out information about why I like this show, so there you go. You should definitely watch K-On!, because it's relaxing, cute, and thoroughly enjoyable. Unless you're looking for a deep plot or conflicts, because it has practically none of that. 
 
10/10 - Would eat cake and drink tea again

    This is THE best anime I've watched. Mainly because I'm such an audiophile and it's a shoujo. If you haven't seen it WATCH IT! I never knew it was popular till I looked into it. If it's popular it's gotta be good right? If you like music, highschool, girls, slice of life, or all of the above this is the anime for you. Gets guitar, drums, bass prices all right. Animation matches the music for the most part. WATCH IT NOW!

    As you may have heard, K-On is a pretty cute show. If you hadn't heard...it is. As many others have said, don't watch it if you don't like cutesy kinds of shows.  
 
K-On is the first full season of anime I've ever completed. I'd seen pictures from it around and I finally decided to watch it to see what it was about. I was pleasantly surprised.  
 
K-On a feel-good kind of show. It'll make you smile. There's nothing too serious going on. There's nothing perverted. It's good clean fun. It would be hard to get offended watching this show, no matter who you are. It's silly high school girls being silly. That's an aspect I really love about the show. It lets girls be girls. It's not trying to turn them into something they're not. They're young girls having fun together, facing joys and struggles in a school club. The lack of drama might be unrealistic, but is nonetheless refreshing.  
 
The characters are all adorable and unique. I personally could identify with different aspects of each character, but I'm sure many people identify specifically with one or the other since the girls are all very different. Mugi, Mio, and Azusa are all shy, but in their own way. Mugi is content being quiet. Mio is more serious and paralyzed by embarrassment. Azusa is reserved and always wants to do what is proper. And then you have your extroverts, Yui and Ritsu. Yui is in her own little world, amused by cute things and food. She's lazy, but charming. Ritsu is more hyper and crazy, always wanting to have fun. These characters together form delightful and inspiring simple friendships. 
 
I didn't watch the series all at once, but spread out over a few months. At times it seemed to jump around a bit. But there is no complex plot. You could really jump in at almost any time and things would probably make sense for the most part. Some episodes just felt like they didn't really matter though, such as training camp episodes or the extra winter-day. They just diverted from the plot, although it isn't complex in any way. Also characters such as Azusa and Sawako Yamanaka seemed random and unnecessary to add in, but once they were there I appreciated them. 
 
I was expecting more original music from the girls, but sadly it wasn't delivered. Much like Mio and Azusa are at times disappointed with the group's progress, so was I. There were only a few songs they wrote. And they were only briefly featured.  
 
K-On holds a lot more potential than it actually presents in many aspects, but it is enjoyable nonetheless because of its innocence.

    ~Short description of what I think of this K-ON!~ 
 
Alright, well 
 
Story: 4 
K-ON is not the best anime's I ever seen. The story is horrid, it's just basically about 5 girls having fun (Sorta like Lucky Star) then it just repeats, and repeats, and REPEATS!! The story is getting really boring, there's nothing to it.  
 
Art: 7 
I have to admit there's very good art in K-ON. The instrument's are very well detailed and drawn, with the characters very smooth around the edges. The school, everywhere they go is beautifully drawn. 
 
Sound: 9 
Okay 1 thing to say about this, I thought all of the voices were adorable and all the songs were just...perfect. HD sound quality is good, very good. 
 
Character(s): 10 
I love all the girls! They are so cute and filled with moe! What's not to love about them? 
 
Enjoyment: 6 
Uh..well, in my opinion, I don't like anime like this, so I didn't really enjoy it very much..But it's just so clinging the anime drags you in with all the characters and all the stuff that happens around them.   
 
Overall: 7 
All I'm going to say is, if you like a band of loli's and them having fun. You well love this anime.

    Let's dive into an anime from a few years ago! K-on! I know many people have seen it but i felt like writing this even though it's from quite a long time ago, well... simply because i wanted to acknowledge this anime in its entirety. If you do happen to read this, i just wanted to let you know my feelings for this show is genuine and not at all biased. Basically my aim for writing this review after the show has aired for so long is simply because like me, there are some people who are only catching up to some old animes a few years after they air and i wanted to let them know how i felt about it. 
 
Just a heads up before we start, but i REALLY LOVE THIS SHOW. It's one of the (if not the only) casual comedic high school slice of life storyline that i've re-watched time and time again. It was also the first actual anime (that i knew of) that i watched before getting into anime. Even when i compared it to some of the other casual anime (especially the newer ones), it stands out as one of my top anime of all time. It's not even an exaggeration to say that if not for this show, i probably would not have bothered delving into the anime world. As usual, i'll try to keep my joy restraints in check and give an honest and unbiased opinion. 
 
Story: 8/10 
 
Like i said, the show is nothing short of spectacular for me and the story itself is one of the reasons why. There are many reason as to why i gave the story an 8. It's interesting, funny and enjoyable. However, there is one thing that tops everything listed before and that is the portrayal of friendship. The friendship between all the characters in the story is astounding and heartwarming. Given that the roster of characters are small to begin with, the growth of their relationship as friends over the span of 2 seasons are something to be admired and warrant an involuntary smile to anybody who watches it. The best part of it is the friendship is not instantaneous, but instead nurtured ever since the beginning of the first episode until the very last episode which makes the ending episode even more heartbreaking. Of course, the story flow is important as well and boy does it not disappoint. During my viewing of the show, never once had i thought that the show was rushed nor were there any plot lines that were lacking. It was as if you were watching a show where the characters start from the literal beginning and slowly mature along with you, the viewer. Everything in the show is paced orderly and not skipped ahead, or left out to the viewers. Every musical skill and talent, character and personality growth, and overcoming obstacles are tackled in a proceeding fashion alongside the viewer. Not to mention, the comedic value in the show is great in itself, and every flashback story is entertaining and in some cases, touching. This is perhaps everything in a nutshell.  
 
Art: 8/10 
 
For an anime of that time, the artwork is quite amazing. However, as with all casual anime, albeit amazing, it doesn't really stand out much. So why such a high score given (8) ? Well, here's the thing. The artwork is highly compatible with the music as both complement each other perfectly. With already amazing graphics for a casual anime of 5 to 7 years ago (not sure), the way it works together with the music is really a masterpiece. I would say that both these 2 work together so well, it always creates a very fitting atmosphere for the show. Rainy scenes with relaxing music, or the mischievous tune with playful cutscene.  
 
Sound 10/10 
 
10.... is the highest score i could give. I highly regret not being able to give a higher score for the music and soundtrack deserved way more than a measly score of 10. Let me summarize: Music, epic. Soundtrack, holy goddess of amazing. First impression? Never had a better one. The fine line that always separates perfection and great is the first impression and K-on did an impressive job of that. Every literal song in the show hits me so hard the first time i hear it. From the vocal music to the instrumental music, every one of them felt different and gives off a different kind of joy and pleasure to my ears. From a fast playful tune, to the rainy solemn peaceful music, from the light and jumpy music to the rock and fast paced jam, all of them were enjoyable. And the way it complements the artwork gives it even more of a bonus! Sure, most other shows have great music too, BUT the only difference is that K-on had a much higher impact on first impressions than the others do. A very fine example of this would be Love Live. Love Live is one of the most popular series ever made, and one of the most popular idol band to date. I love all the Love Live songs too but it took some getting used to before favoritism unlike K-on which became an instant like. 
 
Character 10/10 
 
If you watched the show, then you wouldn't even need to read this to know why it got a 10. All of the characters are extremely likeable and adorable. One thing i wanted to talk about though and that is the connection of friendship bond between the characters. The bonds of friendship between the five main characters are no joke as the developers made them and created the story such that every character has an interwoven interaction and bond between one another. It's not just 2 pairs of best friends or flimsy and simple friendships. Throughout the whole 2 seasons, there have been episodes that illustrated how every character feels about one another, even the characters who seem to have no relation to the other. There are even some episode that are dedicated to deepening the bonds between two seldom interacted characters, resulting in interweaving the bonds between all of them even tighter, making them more than just close friends, but portraying them as a family. Of course, the personality and development of each character is extremely well balanced, so that no one outshines the other. All in all, this show has an extremely good character balancing along with story character growth and development. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
 
Needless to say, after all the things above said and done, i really enjoy watching this show as it fills me with waves of emotions every time. With great plot, art, and epic music and character, i highly recommend you to watch it if you are a fan of music, comedy genre. Even if you are not and just want a good anime to start off your otaku life. I still recommend this. Give it a try, i promise you won't regret it ;)

    K-On! was the first anime I watched after visiting Tokyo and wow it changed my life!! 
 
Story: 
K-On isn't a traditional slice of life anime with a generic storyline about achieving ones goals by the end of the series. And this detour from convention is what brings about the comedy and truly touching moments in K-on. 
 
Art: 
The art follows that of a moe anime, especially during comedic scenes. However, the general animation is detailed and serene when it needs to be. This is specifically shown during the opening credits and the intricate details of the band's performances. 
 
Sound: 
For an anime focusing on a girl's high school band, the OP and OST of K-on is right up there with the best musical animes. Whether its Fuwa Fuwa Time, U&I or Tenshi ni Fureta, its performed and expresses perfectly the feelings of the characters. I love the fact that when Yui loses her voice in before one performance, you can here the croakiness when she sings backup vocals. Talk about attention to detail!! Furthermore, the voice actresses even learnt their respective characters instruments and performed a live concert which is totally awesome and shows how much work and dedication was put into this anime. 
 
Character: 
The characters are well fleshed out and given a good balance of performance and screen time. Each character brings a different personality to the group and this brings about the conflicts and comedic moments in the series.  
 
Overall: 
I never though I'd get into slice of life or moe anime, but K-on changed that and to this day is still one of the best animes I have ever seen. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a good laugh or enjoy pop/punk rock music. Shame they didn't continue the series onto when the girls start university as depicted in the manga.

    Wow.  
 
I'm just taken back by such an experience, K-on is truly a masterpiece. It has a cast that rivals Evangelion and Monogatari. Art and animation that's striking a memorable. I've never laughed harder at anything. K-on is the most fun I've ever had with an anime. 
 
K-on is simple, yes but complex. Each member of the cast was perfectly built to mold into each other's personality while standing out on their own. I could just watch them all talk about wet bread and still be entertained.  
 
Each girl has time to really grow as a person in small ways over the course of the series. Each one learns a little more about themselves in silence. Just with stares and quick glances we're put into the world of this character. This isn't mentioning Yamada's amazing direction. 
 
I have many scenes that are forever in my head. For emotional moments and the funny ones. So many little gags and leg movements are playing in my head right now, and that's great. It's a testament to how well Yamada can direct. She can make a scene stick with you. I will forever laugh at Yui playing the castanets and when Mio fell over. 
 
That scene in particular is funny because we expect a panty shoot but get a rice bowl colored to Mio's paintes which is goofy and funny. And it's shoot in a way in which you'll remember it and giggle a little when it comes up in your mind. But it also still appeals to that crowd giving them the idea of Mio's panites. It's a win win situation.  
 
The more you watch the show the more you laugh. You become friends with these girls and laugh with them. You can guess how they'd react to situations in real life because they feel like real people to you. 
 
The feeling from K-on is one no other anime has ever recreated. Well many may try to be as great they all can't see how everything adds up to make K-on. 
 
K-on's great because of the stellar art and animation, and the lovable real characters.

    A story of students that go through their everyday school life as a light music club. 
 
There is no story behind it, but it will surely bring music to a new level of fun. 
 
If you're one of those cute and moe fans along with comedy, I suggest you watch this! because it comes greatly recommended with it's music. 
 
If it will make you watch the show then I'll tell you a little secret, this anime was one of the reasons I started learning to play the electric guitar.

             Basically this show is like a cleaner version of beck with all girls and more comedy. It centers around our ditsy main female character Yui. She is trying to decide what club to join in her school. All of the others that she's looked at weren't really her thing. They either required to much work, or were complex things that she couldn't understand.  
 
	As you can tell Yui is a really lazy girl. The only thing she works hard at is eating really, and of course guitar later on. Being this kind of girl, I was surprised to see her voiced by Stephanie Sheh (I watched the dubbed). Mainly because a lot of the roles she has been in (that I've seen) have been quiet, and shy girls. Like Hinata from Naruto, or Orohime from Bleach. So seeing her voice a more outgoing character was a new experience. However, she pulled it off better than I thought she would so I was happy. 
 
	Yui then decides to join the “Light Music club” thinking that their name meant that they played light music. Because apparently she play this...clicking type instrument, which it's name I'm spacing on, back when she was younger. However after joining she finds that not to be the case. 
 
	Desperate for members, as well as a guitar player, the club is still one short after Tsumugi joins, they are ecstatic when Yui shows up. However Yui had planned to quit right away, so when the other three members all were showering her with gratitude and sweets. It made it really hard for Yui to quit. However, after confessing that that was her purpose in coming here. She does end up joining after the three tell her that they will help her learn guitar. 
 
	The whole show is basically about how the four grow as a band members and friends, along with gaining recognition at there school. There are hardships along the way, but they all manage to work there way through it. The comedy in this is also something that will have you rolling on the floor laughing at some points. 
 
	Plus, if you have seen my anime list. I've seen almost every romantic comedy ever made. So watching this show, as it doesn't have romance, was a tough choice. However I did, and I was not disappointed. This show is definitely in my top 10 now. 
 
	Cons of the show: These are the problems I have with K-On! First of all, my biggest problem was how quickly Yui learned the guitar. In one of the episodes she played a solo out of nowhere, completely throwing me off. I have played guitar for almost three years now, but I still could never play that solo that she played. Not to mention how Ui was able to play it when Yui was sick, like she had been playing for a long time. All I'm saying is the guitar is harder to learn than this show makes it out to be. I know. If you want a show that show's it more accurately than watch Beck. 
 
	My only other con is one that bothers me every episode, and that is Tsumugi's eyebrows....yea okay not really a con, but they still freak me out. 
 
	Story (9) Not to original, but It is played out really well none the less. About a band working together to make it big, along with everyone's problem's. I know I've mentioned Beck a lot in this, but that's because It's the only other show I've watched like this. It does follow Beck's storyline pretty close, except for the fact that Beck is looking for recognition in the world. K-On is looking for recognition in just there school pretty much, along with gaining more club members. If you like lighthearted comedy's that like to have fun with music, and not take it too seriously. Than K-On! Is better for you than Beck. 
 
	Characters (10) The characters in this is what make the show what it is. Each character is unique in their own way. Mio with her shyness, and her fear of just about everything. Ritsu with her crazy antics, and childish manner. Yui with her....ok Yui is a lot like Ritsu actually. Except for Yui is really lazy. Tsumugi with her awkward love for girl's interacting with another, and fascination with simple things. And Azusa (band member that comes later after seeing the club play live) with her desire to work the club harder at their music, along with her cute antics that are forced upon her by the other members, mainly Yui. 
 
	Though some characters can be pretty cliche, but honestly who cares. If you like it than why does it matter if it's already been done. After all, you can't just eat one potato chip out of the bag can you?...Did that make sense?...I think it did. 
 
	Sound (10) I've never really know how to judge sound by. Is it for the music that plays in the background? The emotion that is felt throughout the show? Or the voice actors, and sounds of objects in the show? Whatever it is I don't know, but I'm going to make sound the music in this, as It's a show about music. 
 
	Every song in this show is really catchy. Though, many of them have some pretty bizarre lyrics. But, since the songs aren't in English themselves, I'm ok with that. My favorite song is definitely the ending song for the first season. I would watch it every episode, It never got old for me. 
 
	Animation/Art (8): The way I see it is there are four kind's of animation. There is simple and cute, simple and ugly, complex and beautiful, and complex and overdone. This show is of course the simple and cute one. It's not amazing animation, but it's a really cute one. Nothing unique about it, but I still really like it. Another similar animation that comes to mind when I think about it is “Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions.” Though Chunibyou is more closer to the complex and beautiful, they are very similar in style. 
 
	Enjoyment (10): I freaking enjoy this anime more than eating Pocky while playing Soul Calibur. It's definitely something that I would recommend to anyone who likes the lighthearted show's with lots of comedy. Even if your not a music fan, I'm sure that you will still enjoy this show. I'm a music guy though, so that's why I love it so much. 
 
	Overall (10) Technically it get's a 9.4/10 which rounds down to a 9, but I just think it deserves a 10. Judge me if you will, but that's what I say.

    K-On is about a group of wacky group of girls who form a band and the comedy of what all four girls get into.  
This is another high school comedy styled anime, their adventures are funny and the show itself will make you smile due to the close to stupidity moments most of the girls have. It's a good anime, its funny, its colourful, it's well animated and even the English dub is decent.  
 
 And its about music, its about girls playing different instruments and singing songs, so people who enjoy music would find appeal in this anime. 
 
But character wise, each girl can easily be described within the first few moments of meeting/seeing them and you can guess the stereotypes they represent, which I admit was a little disappointing, but with High School anime styled comedies I admit they used these types of characters very well. 
 
However, there were moments where I found episodes somewhat pointless. Some episodes can be a bit almost boring to watch for some viewers, (only a maybe twice for me).  
 
But overall, the anime is what it is, a silly, slice of life high school comedy, and for it's genre, it's good.  7-10 overall

Hirasawa Yui entered high school, without knowing what to do. Later on she joined Keion (light music) club, and began her carefree life with her classmates, practicing guitar and eating puddings.  
At this age, there are perhaps hundreds of animes about ""cute girls doing cute things"". Among them, K-ON! already seems old and rather mediocre. Still, it's done pretty decently.  
The whole series feels laid-back, bother-free of reality. I should say I rather dislike this mood. (I would say Love Live is better in this term) But it does have two more realistic girls, and I like them. And, if you are seeking this particular mood in the first place, you probably won't find it disappointing. Indeed, those realistic elements add flavor to the interaction of 5 girls as well as whole enjoyment for audience.  
I've heard that KyoAni was in lack of money when they made this, so no wonder its art quality, although good, is not as good as other KyoAni series. Yet its simplistic drawing style gives a particular feeling, blended with its general mood. (sort of like Lucky Star) 
The songs are pretty enjoyable to listen, especially the op and ed, really cool.  
If you like slice of life shows with a little reference to reality (by reality, I actually mean the harshness of life), you should definitely check this popular series.

    K-On! is a show that will not surprise you or make you cry but it is most certainly worth the watch if you are just looking for something casual! 
The series has no distinct story elements that make it stand out, the entire show is essentially a generic Slice of Life / Musical anime with a fantastic premise and soundtrack. 
 
We start off with our main character, who is quite the airhead, joining the ""Light Music club"" with no musical ability at all, the members of said club convince her to stay despite the lack of music skill and she decides to purchase a guitar and learns it in a few episodes like some kind of god. From there, the anime introduces the teacher and a few other characters who add to the story overall but nothing special. The characters in this series all have there own traits that make them easy to seperate from one another and are very happy most of the time, but once again, nothing special. 
 
The animation is crisp and playful at the same time. There is so much emphasis on bringing these characters, the music and there surroundings to life which I have to give Kyoto Animation credit where credit is due. They have shown time and time again with series such as ""Hyouka"" and ""Clannad"" that they can emerge you into an animated world with the great amount of effort that goes into producing each series. 
 
The tracks ""Cagayake! GIRLS"" (OP) and ""Don't say 'lazy"" (ED), they are very catchy and give you a sense of what you want out of the music that the Light Music Club will play. Sadly, they only play like 2 songs throughout the entire series and they don't live up to the two tracks previously introduced.   
 
In conclusion, I believe this show to be worth watching despite some of the disappointments it brings. K-On! is a very cute, lighthearted and adventurous series with colorful animation and a good OST. Even though the story and aspects of the characters don't deliver, everything else does. 
 
Enjoy your tea and cake everyone!

    Honestly, I am very surprised at how much I liked this show. I felt great unease while watching the first episode and the only reason I continued watching was because I'd already downloaded all the rest as well. At first it just felt like I'm not meant to watch this thing - now that I'm done with it, I feel a bit like Azusa after she joined the light music club, thinking ""This isn't for me, what's with all the cuddling and being cute and childish""...my opinion has changed as well as hers. 
 
The animation quality didn't seem that great when I first got into the show (compared to Haruhi for example), but later on I started thinking it was perfect. I don't know if that's also a matter of adjusting or if the animation quality really increased exponentially as the show progressed. As for the music and voicing, it's extraordinary. Every character has a lovely distinct voice and every single song has gotten into my daily playlist. There isn't much to the plot but I guess the creators of this anime were going for that ""light"" feel here as well; let's just say it certainly is original for the most part and enough to keep you glued to the screen till the very end. 
 
K-ON! may seem simple at first but trust me, it's an acquired taste. The more you watch it the more you like it. I'm not the type of guy to watch something like this and I was still smiling in an odd, benevolent way throughout the show, watching it was pure joy.

    K-On! is probably one of my all time favorite animes. It's so fun and so very cute! 
 
I enjoyed the dubbed version, despite the criticism it receives- I think the voices matched the characters very well. This anime is outstanding mostly because of the relationships the girls were able to develop.  Not only that but you can't help but love them.  
 
Ritsu and Mio are already friends in the beginning but you can see their bond grow as well as with the other girls. Yui is the cutest character ever, she gets distracted and she just finds ways to keep them all together even though she messes up more often than not.  
 
The only flaws in this anime was that their parents were always gone- for the entire anime. I mean, that happens in a lot of animes but, c'mon, do their parents really like travelling more than seeing their daughters grow up? (mainly referring to Ui and Yui). 
 
At the very end I cried my eyes out- it was just so perfect. I really recommend this anime if you're into Hetalia or perhaps Lucky Star, because even though there is a plot, it moves very slow and some episodes are random- but you get used to it!!

    Story: 
Well as stated before, the story is basic and simple. When the show was still to air, all that they gave us was just 1 or 2 short sentences on the story and premise of what K-On was going to be. I thought that it was clever since it engages viewers to find out more about it. But actually, there was nothing more to it than that! The story wasn’t really a strong point of K-On, since this was generally just a heartwarming, cute and entertaining show. The basic premise was good, but it wasn’t something new and original. 
 
Rating: 7/10 
“Nice story plot, but it could have been more original and better.” 
 
 
Art / Animation: 
I loved the art used in K-On! Definitely one of the highlights of the show. The character designs were also the ones who designed the characters of Kannagi, which I loved as well. The art is definitely unique and is something you don’t see in your average anime, which was great. The backdrop was nothing special, but it definitely was nicely done and suited the show. My only concern was that the animations near the end of the show (at Episode 12 to be exact) were bad. What’s more, it definitely screwed up when they were performing at Episode 12, but it was nothing major. 
 
Rating: 9/10 
“Cute and lovable designs that are unique. The animation started to get rusty near the end which took resulted in it not getting a perfect 10.” 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
K-On was very entertaining and engaging. It definitely cracked me up and the lovely characters definitely was one of the reasons. Kudos to Yui’s voice who is also new to the industry and excelled amazingly as Yui. I thoroughly enjoyed watching K-On and it isn’t something to be forgotten. 
 
Rating: 9/10 
“Nice and heartwarming and thoroughly enjoyable.” 
 
 
Final Rating: 25 / 30 
“K-On is definitely something not to be forgotten. Its quirky characters and lovely art was something to look forward to in every episode. A great show and is recommended to everyone, especially those looking for a laugh and moe characters!”

    This show is all about girls in high school.  It is mildly humorous, in fact just enough so to keep me watching through both seasons 1 and 2 -- 41 episodes in all.  It is mostly light drama about relationships and funny anecdotes from high school days. The story is entirely about a group of girls and their friends; there are no male characters other than an incidental teacher or shop-keeper throughout the entire series.  There is no romance whatsoever either, and  it has no ecchi or fan service at all. 
 
I liked the characters, but the story was very weak, in the sense that there were no serious dramatic moments at any point.  It was almost entirely slice-of-life.  If you want something very light to watch to fall asleep to, this one is not half-bad, but it won't be winning any dramatic achievement awards. 
 
Finally, there is an OVA movie, that movie takes place after the end of the second season.  Watch it last.

    I loved this show. There's no other way to say it. From the characters, humor and its story line or should I put it more ""sequence of events that lead to a bang"". I remember seeing this show on ABC3 once and it was this totally random episode, not going to lie I didn't like it. Therefore I sort of told myself never to see this anime. I know I know, I never usually do that. I was being stupid, so I gave it a go. And I can't wait to see season 2 which I heard was much better than season 1. This anime could possibly become my favourite anime, just from the quality of season 1. The very first episode I thought was actually a brilliant introduction to this show. You might not get the appeal at first, but throughout the first few episodes you do. This show felt very real. The setting, the character designs and just scenes in the anime, felt so natural. This show is fun and comes with such enjoyment. One thing I like about this anime is high lack of fan service. Not to say I don't mind service (I don't like girls haha so I could care less) this is honestly one of the first anime slice of life/comedy that I've been able to take really seriously. The studio bought these characters to life, treating them is respectfully pleasing way. its just awesome enjoying the anime so much and not rolling my eyes at random unneeded fans service thrown in my face. If this anime does use fan service, it uses it very very rarely and often it is needed for the team members to react to. The only complaint I have about this anime, is that sometimes the main character could get really irritating, but with development she becomes more serious. I could go on and on about the depth of this anime, but I'm just going to end it with a.. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

    I have only seen the 1st season of this wonderful anime and parts of the 2nd season. I love the dynamics of the characters and the fact that it is a school life anime, I love it! I was sceptical at first, but it was found to be a wonderful anime with sweet characters and showing life as the girls mature and improve with their music. It is that music that brings them together. It is just a fun, cute anime depending on what mood you are in. I recommend this for fans that like school animes like Azumanga Daioh or Lucky star.

    Okay, so when i read about K-on i was like really... im not gonna watch this i mean its like a girly anime with you know all that but i didn't really have much to do so i ended up watching it and when i finished it it was like waoh.... that's all i had i mean the ending was sad in my opinion but it was one of the best animes ever i liked how the characters developed throughout the whole anime and the 2nd season was even better. The music that they played in the anime itself was great, these songs were like everyday normal songs some of them were funny and all plus the openings and endings were amazing as well they were well made for this particular type of anime so over all i would say that from what i thought in the beginning about this anime that it might be lame and all i have to take it all back its on my top 10 now one of my all times favorites!!!!  =P

    K-On! is the simple story of a girl named Yui, who has no special talents and is a complete klutz. As she enters high school she’s intent on finding a place where she belongs and may excel. What she comes across is the light music club, a tiny group who barely have enough members for the school to allow them to conduct business. She gets to be the guitarist for their band, and from there the series takes us through the lives of these four (later five) girls as they love life and enjoy friendship and occasionally get around to playing music. 
 
Of course, none of this is groundbreaking (Kyoto Animation also did the Haruhi Suzumiya series, which has pretty much the same basic plot behind it, though it is completely different in the character and execution department). In fact, the school club thing is a go-to for high school based anime and K-On! is not the first, nor the last to ever use this plot. But it is one of the best examples. 
 
What K-On! doesn’t have is much of a story. It’s a slice of life that goes through a year and a half of these girl’s lives in twelve episodes. Of course there’s not much cohesiveness. But each episode is fun as hell to watch. 
 
What makes the series so entertaining is the cast. Very rarely do I commend the character department, but I found not a single bad character in K-On!. I enjoyed every character’s company; some more than others of course, but that’s beside the point. 
 
Yui’s journey to learn the guitar and discover herself is fairly compelling, though not what makes K-On! what it is. It’s her interactions with the other members. Mio, the bassist, is a scaredy-cat though very mature and the voice of reason. Ritsu, the drummer, is a wild child and always messing with everyone. Tsumugi on keyboard is the rich and motherly character who also seems to be a fan of yuri. And Azusa, who joins the club as Yui and pals become second years, is the one who actually has ambitions and wants to practice. Put them together, and they are a fun cast of characters who play off of each other really well and never annoy. 
 
My major problem with K-On! lies in the fact that there is very little music. It’s why I loved Azusa so much, she came into the club and wondered where the hell the music was at and why the hell the girls only seemed to drink tea and eat cake (which, by the way, takes up about two thirds of the show). The very little music that is played is okay, though nothing really catchy. Which is weird considering the song from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (which, by the way, was not a music anime) is a lot more memorable and catchy than anything from K-On! Not even the theme song is all that great. The best song in the entire show is the ending, which is fairly catchy. Even then, the lyrics for these songs are God-awful painful. Then again, these are fifteen year old girls, so I guess I can give it a pass. 
 
High production values show through in the animation. Vibrant and colorful, the show is a pleasure to look at. The characters are all adorable. The attention to details during the musical sections is amazing (it’s like you’re watching a real person play guitar or play the drums, it’s quite remarkable). Aside from the characters, K-On! definitely has great animation going for it. 
 
So let’s recap: K-On! has fantastic characters, is surprisingly funny and occasionally heartfelt, has some decent music, and has great animation. It’s truly a treat and a fantastic slice-of-life as long as you don’t mind spending more time drinking tea then actually playing music.

    So in case you've never watched K-on here's a summary: 
K-on is about 5 girls that start a rock band in an all girls school. Together they grow up and enjoy high school together. 
K-on is gifed a lot so you may have seen it, believe me it as good as it looks.  
 
The plot for K-on isn't amazing, and I'm saying this as a hardcore K-on fan. What makes K-on so special is its soundtrack and characters. It brings a whole new light to rock. The band (Houkage tea time) makes, no creates adorable/catchy music without breaking the rules of rock. The characters are crazy cute and get along very well demonstrating the usual high school best friends. The art is good not great and the animations are average.I enjoyed this anime a lot but it's not for everyone.

    Okay, let me get this out of the way first. I love the music of K-On. I listen to it non-stop after watching the anime. I just can't get enough of it. The lyrics are so damn cheesy that if you were to sing translate and sing them to someone else you'd sound like a little girl, but that's not a bad thing. The Openings and Endings are amazingly written and fun to listen to and try to hopelessly sing along to. The actual times when HTT perform, those are done beautifully, and the songs rival GirlDeMo for some of the best songs in anime that isn't from an OP or ED (and maybe Lelouch's theme from Code Geass). 
 
I will kinda be using this to review both seasons, so bear with me. 
 
Story... Let's see. A girl who knows nothing about music decides to join a school music program to avoid the fate of being a NEET. At the time I watched this I wasn't hugely into anime, so I had no clue what this meant, but now i just find the idea of Yui becoming a NEET both hilarious and a real possibility. She joins to find three people who can't make a full band who instantly accept her, only to find out later that she can't play. From their hilarity ensues. 
 
Now, as a musician, it is painful to see how little amount of the time that the characters have is devoted to their practice, especially in their ""rehearsal sessions."" However, the times you do see them practice, also as a musician, I can actually tell how hard they are working. And having someone close to me who don't grasp music as well as me (although not as bad as Yui), I understand Yui's slow grasp of the music world. 
 
Okay... what else can I say. While this anime is about music, it tries for a lot more comedy, which in no way does it fail at. The stupid situations that their supervisor puts them through are just awkward enough to make me laugh, but not so awkward that I feel awkward. (I'm looking at you WataMote). Overall, the story is a Slice of Life with music thrown in, and that's not a bad thing. Hibike! Euphonium or other music based animes may focus more on the side of music, and I appreciate those as well, but this still manages to have enough that it's not like Glee where they suddenly know a song they've never practiced. 
 
Okay, onto other aspects of the show... I may have spent too long vaguely describing the story. Okay, I think the art in K-On is cute. That is what it is trying to pull off, a cute and comedic anime. It's not supposed to be taken seriously. It's supposed to overload you with stupid situations that make you laugh. The art style really complements the overall anime in a way that just enhances it. My first introduction to a fair amount of anime stereotypes was this anime, and I honestly can't count that amount of times I said ""Kawaii"" in response to this... 
 
The characters. You have four characters (well, eventually five) whose personalities contrast each other greatly. The always bubbly one who has talent but often times doesn't work hard enough to prove it. The energetic one who would be perfect if you put her behind a drumset... Wait... The shy one who has amazing ideas but doesn't feel confident enough to share, and gets humiliated by the other members of the band (in a cute way, not a mean way). Finally, the rich girl who really doesn't get normal life (insert Hardware Store by Weird Al Yankovic), but actually does work hard at what she likes (which is music). They all work together with a great supporting cast to make hilarious moments and great music. 
 
Also, I don't know how hard I have worked to learn Azu-nyan's part in Fude Pen Boru Pen on guitar... I thought i might have to praise the music one more time. 
 
Overall, K-On is a fun ride, and I honestly cried in the very last episode (I told you I was reviewing both seasons) which surprised me so much. I don't think I've loved many animes that much, even if it is a silly comedy with some damn good music. I think that, with all its flaws and such a silly execution, it is something I could just watch any time I'm really feeling down or just need something fun. I recommend it just as a fun anime to watch and nothing else.

    I am writing this review as a person who has just finished the series including season 2. I will be watching the movie tomorrow. As I finish this anime, it has really made me tremendously sad because of losing it.  
To start off, I will comment on the story. The story was fantastic, it furnish the typical.high school life with music. Sounds plain? Exactly. But even plain commoners food can taste delicious if it is heartwarming. K-On does it perfectly. 
The art blew my mind. I have always been.bias towards modern anime due to assumption of netter art. Tip #1 DO NOT I swear DO NOT judge the anime based on the poster because turtles and tortoises, it was beautiful. There was no sign of poor quality and it destroys a few anime in 2015. 
The music was mind blowing. It is an anime about music and it shook my heart. I was never a big fan of music in any genre but laced with brilliant storytelling, the music came to life. 
The characters were unique in every way. There's no usage of cliche characters but common personality. they each have a stake in the anime, spoke a certain tale and were all.lovable. You know an anime is good when you look all.the characters including the sides 
 
Here comes the score that matters which is my enjoyment. It xontribues directly to the overall score of the anime which should be done across the board. I have words but j cannot speak it. It is sad, you will tear up but you will love the process. You lose something which is your love. I really liked this anime and it has just this brillant ambience to it that makes you feel.humane again. If you are looking for something to fill in the empty space in your heart, why not pick this up and give it a try?

    K-on is an anime about four girls who start a light music band witch i don't get why they call it light music when they play some metal but anyway. The story line was not all that great the one girl was always shy and the one was sort of mentally challenged the other was self centered.The other was a girl who's related to the music store owners. For the art i gave it a six because the people actually took there time and didn't use machines for most of the work like in lost animes. The sound quality was not all that great it was in japanese to start off but also there was the problem with it skipping out every once in a while. The characters were outstanding it is amazing that japanese artists can make girls look so awsome. Enjoyment is different for everyone i didn't really like it. Overall i gave it a six if you like to see girls play guitar then this is the anime for you.

    Quite frankly my favorite anime of all time. 
 
All the characters are adorable in one way or another, and the comedy of the series will not get old. 
Beign also an anime about music (Even though they don't really focus too much into it), the music is also amazing, the background music is so well made that it will make you feel what the situation is like. Sad moments will have music that will also make you feel sad, and the funny moments will have funny music and so on. 
The few downsides to this anime is the animation, despite it's cute art style, it's somewhat poorly animated for the first few episodes, and spotting  asymmetrical eyes is not a rarity, as it does happen somewhat often (However, they are not really noticeable unless you look at it closely). 
 
It really makes me sad how there's never gonna be a 3rd Season. 
 
K-ON! is definitely worth watching, the story isn't really the most serious, but the comedy justifies it.  And the few moments it gets serious, it just somehow catches you in the mood. 
 
This anime, for me, is perfect.
